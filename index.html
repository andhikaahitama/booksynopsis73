Taken in its entirety, his book is both an illuminating account of one actor's career and an unparalleled commentary on twenty years of movie-making history.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Story of Doctor Dolittle</h2><p>Doctor Dolittle is truly extraordinary. Not only can he talk to the animals--he can also understand what they say to him. One day Doctor Dolittle receives a message from Africa. The monkeys there need his help. So he sails off from his home,bringing along all his animal friends: Dab-Dab, the duck; Jip, the dog; Gub-Gub, the baby pig; Polynesia, the parrot; and Too-Too, the owl. The doctor and his friends have many amazing adventures. They even meet the rarest of all animals, the two-headed pushmi-pullyu!</p><p>Listening to Alan Bennett read <i>The Story of Doctor Dolittle</i> is the next best thing to borrowing someone's kindly British grandfather for a marathon round of bedtime stories. Bennett seems to have an unlimited supply of voices, accents, and inflections on the ready, which he calls upon to impart each of Doctor Dolittle's animal companions with a distinct personality and voice.<p> Bennett's reading of the classic children's book is deliciously whimsical. As the tale opens, Dr. John Dolittle is on the verge of the realization that he's just not much good as a people doctor--his earnings have dwindled to a paltry sixpence a year. He takes the advice of his creaky-voiced 183-year-old parrot, Polynesia, and learns animal languages. As an animal doctor, he's brilliant and soon finds himself and his animal friends sailing to Africa to treat an epidemic among monkeys. With no trouble at all, Doctor Dolittle cures the monkeys, but he and his menagerie become embroiled in one adventure after another. They narrowly escape sinking in their leaky ship, thanks to some stowaway rats with surprisingly cultured and well-bred diction, who alert the doctor just in time. The doctor and his friends later run afoul of the Barbary pirates, known to be "a bad lot," for whom Bennett devises a hilariously unidentifiable but thoroughly villainous accent. With the help of some fast-talking (and hungry) sharks, Doctor Dolittle "persuades" the pirates they'd be much better off as birdseed farmers.</p><p> The adventures are exciting, but not frightening. Bennett's reassuring voice and the fact that the doctor always forges a peaceful solution to each predicament make the recording appropriate for small children. Adults, too, will find the stories appealing and are certain to appreciate the understated social satire occasionally voiced by the perceptive animals. The reading is rounded out by delightful orchestral selections from Camille Saint-Saï¿½ns's "Carnival of the Animals," which signal the beginning and end of each tape side. (Running time: 150 minutes, two cassettes) <i>--Elizabeth Laskey</i></p>"Any child who is not given the opportunity to make the acquaintance of this rotund, kindly, and enthusiastic doctor/naturalist and all of his animal friends will miss out on something important."-- <i>Jane Goodall</i></p><h2>Subliminal</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><strong>Guest Reviewer: V.S. Ramachandran on <em>Subliminal</em></strong> <br> <em><strong>V.S. Ramachandran</strong> is a neuroscientist known for his work in the fields of behavioral neurology and visual psychophysics. The author of </em>The Tell-Tale Brain<em>, He is the Director of the Center for Brain and Cognition, and is currently a Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Neurosciences Graduate Program at the University of California, San Diego.</em> <p>This delightfully accessible yet intellectually rigorous book transcends traditional boundaries between neuroscience, psychology and philosophy, to tackle the riddle of the unconscious mind. Freud bashing is a popular intellectual pastime these days (I myself have been guilty on occasion) but Mlodinow shows that by emphasizing the unconscious he was on the right track: we are completely unaware of the vast majority of events going on inside our brains. The book presents compelling evidence gleaned from a variety of sources to show that much of our behavior is governed not so much by our conscious mind &#x2013; which is prone to claim credit &#x2013; but by a cauldron of motives, drives and unconscious propensities of which we are largely oblivious. Indeed, most of our actions are carried out by the unconscious mind (or minds ) which exists in peaceful harmony with the conscious person "inside" your body. The question of why we are conscious of the tip of the iceberg of neural activity continues to remain elusive but, perhaps, the answer can be found by asking what you can do without being conscious; What&#x2019;s the IQ of the unconscious mind? Here Mlodinow offers dazzling new insights into what the unconscious can and does do, to influence our lives.</p> <p></p>LEONARD MLODINOW received his PhD in theoretical physics from the University of California, Berkeley, was an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at the Max Planck Institute, and now teaches at the California Institute of Technology.

Said to be one of J.R.R. Tolkien's childhood favorites, <i>The Princess and the Goblin</i> is the story of the young Princess Irene, her good friend Curdie--a minor's son--and Irene's mysterious and beautiful great great grandmother, who lives in a secret room at the top of the castle stairs. Filled with images of dungeons and goblins, mysterious fires, burning roses, and a thread so fine as to be invisible and yet--like prayer--strong enough to lead the Princess back home to her grandmother's arms, this is a story of Curdie's slow realization that sometimes, as the princess tells him, "you must believe without seeing." Simple enough for reading aloud to a child (as I've done myself more than once with my daughter), it's rich enough to repay endless delighted readings for the adult. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>George MacDonald was a prolific writer who enjoyed enormous success with his books for both adults and children. Among his admirers were J.R.R Tolkien, Tennyson, Kingsley and C.S. Lewis.</p><h2>Superman: The Men of Tomorrow</h2><p>A new era for SUPERMAN begins as Geoff Johns takes the reigns - and he's joined by the legendary super-talent of John Romita, Jr. in his first-ever work for DC Comics!<br><br>Enter Ulysses, the Man of Tomorrow, into the Man of Steel's life.

Le Guin ( Searoad: The Chronicles of Klatsand , HarperCollins, 1991) is as expert in creating mellifluous and enchanting essays as she is in creating the luscious and complex worlds of her fiction. Stylistically, she manages a balance between quasi-academic seriousness and conversational humor (a balance that original editor Susan Wood does not attain in her introductions). Despite being three to 13 years out of date, depending on the extent of revision, her comments on the state of the genre, the process of writing, and the influence of gender on literature are as fresh as ever. The book is dated only in its ratio of female to male writers of fantasy and sf, which is now closer than it was when Le Guin first wrote. Highly recommended for all literature and women's studies collections.<br><i>- Keith R.A. DeCan dido, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.For Le Guin, writing science fiction or fantasy is an intuitive, self-exploratory act, an inner-space voyage in which she unearths dreams and archetypes that connect her with the outer world. In these conversational, feisty essays, an energizing mind trip for SF fans, she dissects her own fiction, discusses technique and explores the potential of SF and fantasy, which she considers different branches of the same form of writing. Most SF has been regressive and unimaginative, she argues, by portraying authoritarian dystopias instead of democratic socialist societies. She also berates the genre for its marginalization of women, both as fictional characters and as writers. This is essentially a reissue of a 1979 compilation that went out of print in 1982. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>After Gregory</h2><p>Peter Gregory, a 35-year-old high school English teacher with an ex-wife and kids, tries to drown himself in the Ohio River. Failing to manage even that, he decides to hitch a ride east, fleeing the state and escaping accusations of rape and murder. As he assumes and discards aliases along the way, he believes that he can begin again, a fresh start&#x2014;but the past has a habit of catching up with all of us, no matter how fast we run.</p><p><b>Austin Wright </b>(1922-2003) was a novelist, literary critic, and professor of English at University of Cincinnati. He was the author of <i>Tony and Susan</i>."This literary and existential mystery-within-a-novel may remind readers of the fiction of Paul Auster, Don DeLillo, and other authors who chart the modern American search for identity. . . . An intellectual wordsmith's whodunit." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"Wright's fifth novel, a dark, allegorical parable about the links between identity, the past and the need to write, reads like a cross between Paul Auster's <i>The Music of Chance</i> and an episode of the '50s TV series <i>The Millionaire. </i>. . . This novel&#x2014;told mostly in the unusual second-person singular&#x2014;is about writing as a way to reconcile our past with who and what we become; it's Wright's brief but stirring conclusion on this subject that makes the book so special." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Victorian Floral Photo Album</h2><p>Large Oversized Hardbound Album with Ribbon Closing</p><p></p><h2>The Principles of Theology: An Introduction to the Thirty-Nine Articles</h2><p>The Principles of Theology: An Introduction to the Thirty-Nine Articles by W.

Already the machinery had been set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributed among the peasants.&#x201d; &#x2013; John Reed John Reed&#x2019;s Ten Days that Shook the World, published in 1922, is a gripping account of the Russian Revolution that took place just years earlier in the midst of World War I. Of course, nobody knew at the time just how important the Russian Revolution would be geopolitically, especially with the advent of the Cold War less than 25 years later. Reed&#x2019;s account was firsthand; as a journalist, he was in Russia when the Revolution transpired. The book was popular and influential enough that it made the rounds among Russia&#x2019;s leadership, with Stalin himself arguing against some of Reed&#x2019;s theses.</p><p>The situation in St. Petersburg was growing more and more tense. The People's Revolution had begun by overthrowing the corrupt Tsarist regime in March 1917, but the workers and the peasants felt the revolution had much farther to go. Tired of fighting a war that meant little to them, the soldiers also grew restless: "When the land belongs to the peasants, and the factories to the workers, and the power to the Soviets, then we'll know we have something to fight for, and we'll fight for it!"<p> Lenin pressed the Bolsheviks to seize power. On the night of October 24, an organized mass of workers, soldiers, peasants, and sailors stormed the Winter Palace. On the following day, at the opening of the second Congress of Soviets, Trotsky announced the overthrow of the provisional government. Counterrevolutionary forces marched on the capital, but the Revolutionary Army triumphed. After all, "[t]his was <i>their</i> battle, for <i>their</i> world; the officers in command were elected by <i>them</i>. For the moment that incoherent multiple will was one will."</p><p> In <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i> John Reed tells the story of Red October and the Russian revolution from a unique, firsthand perspective. Reed, an American journalist, was on assignment in Russia for <i>The Masses</i>--then the principal radical journal in the United States--and spent his days walking the streets, reading and collecting handbills, newspapers, and posters, and talking to people. As a result, <i>Ten Days</i> crackles with energetic immediacy. At its best moments it reads like a novel: Reed recounts conversations and arguments, details political machinations, and speculates on personal motives. Though this is no mere piece of propaganda, Reed's enthusiasm for the revolution infuses the text (some readers may be put off by Reed's florid prose), casting each counterrevolutionary act in a negative light. Helpful notes flesh out the background for those less familiar with the preceding events and render this a solid work of history. <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i> is a stirring account of a stirring event. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><b>John Reed (1887-1920)</b> was a journalist, activist, poet, and author. In addition to chronicling the Russian revolution, he reported on US labor strikes, the Mexican revolution, World War I, and was a founder of and international delegate for the Communist Labor Party. He is buried at the Kremlin Wall in Moscow.<br></p><h2>CSSM Exam Prep</h2><p>Created by the professionals who administer the CSSM exam, the CSSM Exam Prep, First Edition, is the go-to resource for practicing professionals.

As respected thinker and educator David Willis explores the Nicene Creed in this new book, he provides clues for meaningfully interpreting this most ecumenical of church creeds in the twenty-first century. / Writing especially for educated laypeople, advanced students, and theological educators, Willis eloquently links the ancient creed to life today. As he points out, faith is constantly taking different shapes within broad boundaries like the creed&#39;s perennial truths, and even these truths need to be reinterpreted in each age to keep them intelligible and compelling. Willis admirably achieves this task for our day by elucidating the creed&#39;s statement of faith with analogies drawn from such diverse areas as architecture, graphic art, poetry, sculpture, and psychological theory. / Those seeking to delve into the creed or to deepen a lifelong encounter with it will be enriched by Willis&#39;s reflections.</p><p>David Willis is Charles Hodge Professor Emeritus of Systematic Theology at Princeton Theological Seminary and editor of the Studies in Reformed Theology and History series.

We had only been married 28 days and I was only 28 years old. I went to my church for guidance and answers and of course found none, but one of the nuns there gave me this book -HOW TO RECOVER FROM GRIEF- it took awhile to pick it up and read it, but when I did I found answers and comforting words. This book helped me tremendously, along with family, friends and my church. As years went by I became stronger and passed it on to a friend of my mothers. I now have a friend who within two years has lost her son and her husband, I intend to buy her this book, hopefully it will help her the way it has helped me. I know grief is individual, but this book puts grief at ease for people. It lets people know that itï¿½s ok to cry, laugh or whatever it takes to get through this difficult time in ones life.

Comics star Waid relaunches the series with <i>The Lords of Luck</i>, taking readers on a planet-hopping romp through the DC universe. The story begins when Green Lantern and Batman join forces to investigate a murder. The plot quickly becomes interstellar when Adam Strange, Blue Beetle, Supergirl, and others are enlisted for help. The convoluted plot (aliens attempting to control fate itself) is secondary to the real point of the story, which is an opportunity to play with the heroes and history of DC comics. Longtime readers will likely get the most from this book, which is so packed with references to the DC archives that it even comes with an appendix describing the many references to past stories. Epic in scale, but lighthearted in spirit, this is a book for lovers of heroic adventure comics. Legendary artist Pï¿½rez has a distinct, straightforward style and does a commendable job of depicting the scores of characters who populate the pages.<i>&#x2013;Douglas P. Davey, Halton Hills Public Library, Ontario, Canada</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The Hernandez brothers&#x2019; long-running alt-comic Love and Rockets here changes formats from comic book to annual trade paperback. For the first new-look volume, Jaime returns to his roots. The early episodes of his Locas series contained skewed superhero elements, and now supporting character Penny Century has finally gained long-desired superpowers, at the cost of her sanity, and a dysfunctional gang of superheroines must stop her intergalactic rampage. This departure from the realism of Jaime&#x2019;s recent work retains his humanistic characterization, wry humor, and sensuously slick artwork. Meanwhile, Gilbert presents a cluster of more experimental stories that include a wanderer&#x2019;s trek through a desolate countryside, a gay man seeking escape in a snowy refuge, a kangaroo that hits the jackpot in Vegas, a Martin-and-Lewis-like comedy duo that gets snatched into outer space, and, in a story written by third brother Mario, shenanigans in a Mexican village. All display Gilbert&#x2019;s daringly bold graphic sensibility. The volume&#x2019;s impressive diversity augurs well for the new format, even if the annual wait between installments may feel frustrating to longtime fans. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Death Comes to Cambers (The Bobby Owen Mysteries)</h2><p><p>Police officer Bobby Owen is a weekend guest at Lady Cambers&#x2019;s majestic country pile, there to advise on security following recent burglary scares.

Fly-fishers know the importance of imitating the specific life stage that trout are feeding on, however most current flies only imitate size, shape, and color of the natural insect. Soft-hackled nymphs also imitate movement and behavior. Tying &amp; Fishing Soft-Hackled Nymphs explains how to imitate sub-surface aquatic insects using both traditional and modern soft-hackled nymphs and flymphs along with the most effective presentation techniques. By exploring effective thread and translucent fur body material combinations, as well as game-bird hackle collars, these flies take on life-like properties. These patterns can be fished throughout the water column from the stream bottom--to imitate immature nymphal forms--to the surface mimicking transitional emergers. Drawing on both traditional and evolved patterns and methods, these wingless wet flies will take you beyond for mulaic fishing techniques to unlimited presentation possibilities and will help you catch more trout.</p><p>&#34;Three seconds after being asked to review this excellent new manifesto on tube flies, I thought first I tie flies with feathers and bits and pieces of natural organic animal or whatever!

By the author of the Sookie Stackhouse series. (fantasy). Simultaneous.</p><p>Charlaine Harris is the "New York Times "bestselling author of the Sookie Stackhouse fantasy/mystery series, the Aurora Teagarden and Harper Connelly mystery series, and "Midnight Crossroad," the first Midnight, Texas, novel. She has lived in the South her entire life.<br><p><b>Prologue</b></p><p><br>It isn&#x2019;t the rumbling of the trucks that seizes Manfred Bernardo&#x2019;s attention; it is the silence that falls when their ignitions die. Big trucks often go through Midnight, slowing to stop for (or speeding up to beat) the traffic light at the intersection of the Davy highway and Witch Light Road. Since Manfred&#x2019;s rented house lies on Witch Light Road, he&#x2019;s grown used to the sound until it is simply background music. But the absence of that sound pierces his preoccupation. He&#x2019;s on his feet and opening the front door before he&#x2019;s aware of pushing back from his desk. He grabs a jacket from the rack by the door.</p><p>Glancing across the road, he sees his friend Fiji Cavanaugh come out into her front garden, which is at its bleakest in January. It&#x2019;s cold today, by Texas standards, but sunny. Her cat, Mr. Snuggly, a golden tabby, is at his current favorite sunning spot, the base of the pot where Fiji plans to try a gardenia. Even Mr. Snuggly is staring west.</p><p>Manfred exchanges a nod with Fiji, who is bundled in a quilted coat. He notes that today she has inexplicably arranged her hair in two dog-ears, like a six-year-old. Then he turns his attention back to the trucks. One is an equipment truck, and it&#x2019;s laden with building supplies: boards, bricks, electrician&#x2019;s wire, plumbing pipes, hardware. Two battered white vans have disgorged a clown-car number of small brown men, wearing hoodies they will surely discard as the day warms. Emerging from a Lexus, clearly in charge, is a tall white woman in tan slacks and a blue silk T-shirt. She&#x2019;s wearing a faux-fur vest. Her thick brown hair is gathered back into a sleek ponytail, and she wears silver earrings and a silver necklace. She also wears glasses, with big square tortoiseshell frames, and her lipstick is an aggressive red.</p><p>All these various vehicles, with all their assortment of passengers, have converged around the defunct Roca Frï¿½a Hotel at the southwest corner of the intersection. As far as Manfred knows, it has been closed for decades. The work crews immediately start pulling the boards off the doors and windows and tossing the ancient plywood into a large skip that yet another truck has deposited on the cracked sidewalk. The workmen swarm into the dark interior of the hotel.</p><p>It reminds Manfred of a giant boot kicking a dormant anthill.</p><p>Within five minutes, Fiji has crossed the road to join him. Simultaneously, Bobo Winthrop saunters down the steps of his business and residence, Midnight Pawn, which is situated at the same intersection as the Roca Fria Hotel, but catty-cornered to it. Manfred sees (with resignation) that Bobo is looking quietly handsome today, though he&#x2019;s wearing faded jeans and an ancient T-shirt with an equally ancient flannel shirt open over it. Manfred and Fiji stand with Bobo, and as they do, Manfred sees that west of the intersection, Teacher Reed has come out of Gas N Go; it&#x2019;s directly across the highway from the pawnshop on the east and the hotel on the south. His statuesque wife, Madonna, is standing on the sidewalk in front of the Home Cookin Restaurant with Grady, the baby, who&#x2019;s wrapped in a blanket. She&#x2019;s holding Grady with one arm, shading her eyes with the other. Across the street from Madonna, Joe Strong and Chuy Villegas have stepped out of the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon. Joe is like his name; muscular. He looks as though he may be forty. Chuy is shorter, his dark hair is thinning a bit, and his skin is the color of toast.</p><p>Even the Rev, in his rusty black suit, emerges from his white-painted chapel to cast an unreadable look at all the activity.</p><p>We&#x2019;re only missing Olivia and Lemuel, Manfred thinks. Of course, Lemuel cannot come out during the day, and Olivia is gone on one of her mysterious business trips.</p><p>After a few more minutes of watching and wondering, Joe Strong takes the initiative and strolls across Witch Light Road. He threads his way through the busy men to Boss Woman, who appears to be looking over some plans on a clipboard&#x2014;though Manfred is sure, reading the clues in her stance, that she is well aware of Joe&#x2019;s approach.</p><p>Boss Woman turns to face Joe and extends her free hand to shake his, a professional smile pasted on her face. She is able to look Joe directly in the eyes, Manfred observes. She seems to like what she sees. The well-groomed Joe is pleasant looking and has a warm manner. His mouth moves; her mouth moves. They grin at each other without sincerity. Manfred thinks, It&#x2019;s like watching a ritual. In his peripheral vision, he spies the Rev retreating into his chapel, but the rest of the Midnighters stay outside.</p><p>Bobo turns to Manfred. &#x201c;Had you heard anything about this?&#x201d; he asks.</p><p>&#x201c;No. Believe me, I would have spread the word,&#x201d; Manfred tells his landlord. &#x201c;This is a big thing, right?&#x201d; He is aware that he feels ridiculously excited by this development in the small town where he&#x2019;s lived for less than a year. Rein it in, he advises himself. It&#x2019;s not like the circus has come to town.</p><p>And yet, in a way, it&#x2019;s exactly like that. Fiji&#x2019;s round, pretty face reflects his curiosity. Her eyes are lit up.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; she says, bouncing up and down on the balls of her feet. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to reopen the hotel, huh? How can they even get it back up to code? It&#x2019;s been closed so many years. Everything will need to be ripped out and replaced. Plumbing, electricity . . . floors . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Bobo nods. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been in there. Right after I moved here, Lem and I went in one night. There was a loose board at the back, and Lem pried it open. We had flashlights. He just wanted to show it to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was it like?&#x201d; Manfred asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Spooky as hell. The old reception desk with all the pigeonholes for mail is still there. The light fixtures were just hanging down with all these cobwebs on &#x2019;em. Like a horror movie. High ceilings. Wallpaper coming off in shreds. Smelled like mice. We didn&#x2019;t even go to the second floor. The stairs were a death trap.&#x201d; He smiles. &#x201c;Lem remembered it when it was open. He said it was pretty nice then.&#x201d;</p><p>Lemuel is well over a century and a half old, so it is not surprising that he can remember the hotel in its heyday.</p><p>&#x201c;So why would anyone spend the money to renovate it?&#x201d; Manfred says out loud, since that is the question on all their minds. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be cheaper to build a Motel 6 if you felt like Midnight could support a hotel?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who wants to spend the night here?&#x201d; Fiji asks, another question they&#x2019;ve all thought about. &#x201c;There are three motels in Davy if you go north, and at least six over in Marthasville if you go west. If you go to the interstate, there are a skadillion places to stay. Besides, Home Cookin isn&#x2019;t open for breakfast.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the only restaurant within fifteen miles.</p><p>They contemplate all those facts in silence.</p><p>&#x201c;How many rooms in that hotel?&#x201d; Manfred asks Bobo.</p><p>Bobo looks down at him, blue eyes narrowed in thought. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t think more than twelve,&#x201d; he concludes. &#x201c;The ground floor is the lobby and the kitchen and the dining room, plus there was an ancient phone booth, don&#x2019;t know when that went in . . . and there weren&#x2019;t bathrooms in the rooms . . . so, say four guest rooms on the ground floor plus a bathroom and the public rooms, and then eight on the second floor plus two bathrooms? And the third floor was storage, and staff rooms, Lem said.&#x201d;</p><p>Fiji grabs Bobo&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;You said dining room?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Bobo says, surprised by her agitation. &#x201c;Oh. I get it. The Reeds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how Home Cookin keeps open, anyway. Really. Think about it. How?&#x201d; Manfred spreads his open hands as he asks them.</p><p>But Bobo and Fiji ignore Manfred&#x2019;s question. They are just glad to have a good cook like Madonna in Midnight.</p><p>&#x201c;If they don&#x2019;t open the dining room . . .&#x201d; Bobo says.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be a good thing.&#x201d; Fiji ends his thought. &#x201c;Home Cookin will be busy, Gas N Go will be busy, and maybe even Joe and Chuy will sell more antiques and do more nails.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; Manfred says. &#x201c;That would be all right.&#x201d; Though he really feels he doesn&#x2019;t want anything to change in Midnight, he makes himself admit that a touch of prosperity would be good for the town. His own business is done by telephone and Internet and does not depend on foot traffic.</p><p>Manfred&#x2019;s cell phone rings, and Manfred whips it out of his pocket. He doesn&#x2019;t have to look at the caller ID to know it&#x2019;s Joe, whom he&#x2019;s watched walking back to Chuy.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to have a meeting tonight,&#x201d; Joe says without preamble. &#x201c;Maybe Fiji can go ask the Rev, and Bobo can tell Lemuel. Is Olivia in town?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. What time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here at the shop, whenever it&#x2019;s really dark.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a muffled sound while Joe asks Chuy a question. &#x201c;Seven o&#x2019;clock good?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, I&#x2019;ll tell them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See you then.&#x201d;</p><p>Manfred ends the conversation and passes along the message.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell the Rev, but you can&#x2019;t ever predict what he&#x2019;ll do,&#x201d; Fiji says with a shrug.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put a note downstairs for Lemuel,&#x201d; Bobo says. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll see it the minute he gets up. Maybe Olivia will be back by then.&#x201d;</p><p>That night, when the work crews have gone and the tall woman, too, the inhabitants of Midnight assemble in the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon. Occasionally, they can hear Rasta yapping upstairs in the very nice apartment Joe and Chuy share. &#x201c;I thought he might wake up Grady,&#x201d; Chuy explains. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll calm down in a second.&#x201d;</p><p>Sure enough, Rasta falls silent after everyone has filtered in. The salon area is the front right corner of the store, and the antiques, dusted and arranged attractively, take up the rest. Joe has assembled some folding chairs and an old love seat around a refreshments table. He and Chuy have made lemonade and tea, and there are a couple of bottles of wine. They&#x2019;ve put out a cheese and cracker tray. Fiji has brought a bowl of toasted, salted pecans. Manfred tries one to be polite, then finds it hard to resist grabbing a handful.</p><p>When they all have drinks and food, they choose seats.</p><p>Madonna and Teacher settle on the love seat, with baby Grady drowsing on Madonna&#x2019;s chest. Madonna is regal and a little scary, and she&#x2019;s never been especially friendly. Her husband, Teacher, who is running Gas N Go until another buyer is in place, is the town handyman. Teacher is good at everything. Since he&#x2019;s been working at the convenience store full time, projects are going undone in the town, and everyone is ready for a return to the status quo, including Teacher. Grady has started pulling up and will begin walking, and Madonna&#x2019;s already worried about cooking at the restaurant with him staggering around.</p><p>Joe stands in front of the motley assortment of chairs on which they&#x2019;ve perched and begins, &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what I know.&#x201d;</p><p>They all fall silent and look attentive.</p><p>&#x201c;The woman in charge is Eva Culhane. She&#x2019;s not the owner. She&#x2019;s his or her agent. I don&#x2019;t know who the real owner is, she was real closemouthed about that. Here&#x2019;s what she told me. The hotel is going to reopen as a hotel. But the eight small rooms on the bottom floor will be made into four suites with their own bathrooms, and four rooms on the upper floor will get the same treatment. These will be residence rooms.&#x201d;</p><p>There is an intake of breath because so many people have questions.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Joe says. &#x201c;Wait!&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a little laughter, but they are all too curious or anxious to be very amused.</p><p>&#x201c;The residence rooms will be for people who are in the area for a long-term job, like working for three months at Magic Portal. Or people who are waiting to get in to an elder care situation. As an aside, Eva Culhane told me that there&#x2019;s a waiting list for all the elder care places in a sixty-mile radius. The remaining rooms will be conventional hotel rooms. In the family quarters, there&#x2019;ll be two people living there as staff. A cook will provide breakfast for residents and whoever stays at the hotel. Lunch and dinner will be cooked for permanent residents only, is what I got out of it.&#x201d;</p><p>Madonna&#x2019;s shoulders relax visibly. She gets a few diners from Magic Portal, which is an Internet company, every month. (Thanks to Magic Portal, Midnight has great Internet.) And ranchers come into Midnight every now and then for a meal. But she&#x2019;s in the room with her regulars, right now. More customers would be welcome. Elderly people like traditional food, which is what Madonna cooks.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of staff?&#x201d; Fiji asks.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be two people in residence,&#x201d; Joe repeats.</p><p>&#x201c;Will one of them be a nurse or some kind of medical person?&#x201d; Bobo asks. &#x201c;Sounds like they might need that. And they&#x2019;ll have to hire a maid, I would think. That&#x2019;s a lot of rooms to clean for one person, plus dishes, plus food prep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good questions. We&#x2019;ll have to find out.&#x201d; Joe looks a little chagrined he didn&#x2019;t think of all this.</p><p>&#x201c;Did Ms. Culhane give you a timetable?&#x201d; Fiji asks.</p><p>&#x201c;She said they hope to be open within six months.&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a moment of silence.</p><p>&#x201c;They must have a shitload of money,&#x201d; Teacher Reed says, and Bobo nods. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a quick turnaround,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>Olivia, who&#x2019;s driven in an hour earlier, speaks for the first time.

He just knows his way around the Internet. &#x201c;I can try,&#x201d; he says. Joe hands him a brochure, one that Eva Culhane had given him. It has a corporation name on it, MultiTier Living. Olivia extends her hand silently, and Manfred hands it to her. She looks at the brochure intently before she hands it back.</p><p>When everyone has said everything they had to say (some more than once), Lemuel supports Olivia with his arm as they leave Joe and Chuy&#x2019;s store/salon. The remaining Midnight residents go their separate ways: Teacher, Madonna, and the sleeping Grady cross the street to walk past Home Cookin Restaurant and behind it to their double-wide, the Rev splitting off from them to go right to his bleak little cottage.

Gathering up the corners, he nods his thanks, and Bobo splits away to go into the side door of the pawnshop, which leads to the stairs going up to his apartment.</p><p>Manfred unlocks the front door of his little house, which he rents from Bobo. He passes by his huge curving desk, crowded with computer equipment, to go through the little den (designed as a dining room) and back into the kitchen.

But for one member of the clan, the day turns dark. Chris Napier, prodigal son, suddenly spots the ragged specter of a former friend, Nicky Lanyon&#x2014;a man whose own family was ruined by the same twist of fate with which the Napiers were blessed. And the next morning, Chris is horrified to find Nicky dead, hanging from a tree where the boys once played....<br><br>For Chris, the suicide opens a floodgate of doubt and suspicion. How did his family&#x2019;s wealth slip out of the hands of a great-uncle, brutally murdered before he could change his will? Were the men convicted of the crime truly guilty? And who is the mysterious, seductive woman who claims to know the Napiers&#x2019; darkest secrets? As the crimes of two families are exposed, a series of violent acts shadows him and suddenly Chris knows he&#x2019;s in uncharted waters...until a killer drops one last disguise&#x2014;for the ultimate act of revenge.</p><p>A carefully crafted tale of suspense, <i>Beyond Recall</i> interweaves present and past as Christian Napier sets out to discover the truth behind his great-uncle's murder, committed during the days of rationing and privation following the Second World War. That death provided the foundation of the Napier family's subsequent prosperity, but Christian is led to question the verdict reached in the case by the more recent suicide of an old and abandoned friend. The whole of the action is relayed through Napier's eyes and voice as he struggles to sort out his understanding of what happened before he was born, his own memories as a child, the alcohol-hazed intervening years, and the current arm's-length relationship he maintains with the surviving members of his family. <p> Goddard's sense of place is strong. The Cornish market town of Truro, with its 19th-century cathedral looming over events spanning a century, provides the backdrop for the mystery and also for the shifting fortunes of the British experience. Descriptions of a grand family home transformed into a hotel and conference center, the tiny chain-pulled ferry crossing an estuary as it has done for generations, and Cornwall's unchanging and temperate beauty offer convincing detail beyond the usual place-name dropping. </p><p> Although the denouement is muddled by a confusion of identities and too many people thought dead resurfacing (both to Napier's dismay and delight), the general scheme is entertaining enough and just within the bounds of what's believable, given Goddard's manipulation of the reader's expectations. The central themes of revenge and greed lose some of their power when mixed with a subplot colored by a '90s obsession with sexual misdeeds, but these flaws do not detract from the pleasure of the whole. An enjoyable read, fraught with the tension Goddard's readers have come to expect.</p>"One of Britain's Finest Thriller Writers" <br>- <i>Time Out</i> <p>"Satisfyingly complex...finishes in a rollercoaster of twists"<br>-Michael Hartland, <i>Daily Telegraph</i></p> <p>"Absorbing and intriguing"<br>-T.J.

This book is in a class by itself. <p>Some books are written by arthritis experts who have all the right credentials but who have never had arthritis. They don't really understand what it is like to live with arthritis or what it takes to get well. They just repeat what someone else told them were the best treatment options. </p><p>Other arthritis books are written by people coping with arthritis, but who do not have the training to really understand how conventional or alternative arthritis treatments work. </p><p>The book, Conquering Arthritis, finally combines expert knowledge with a first hand perspective. </p><p>If you are serious about getting well, you need this book.</p>The onset of my arthritis was sudden and left me in chronic, overwhelming pain that often made it difficult to walk even a few steps without passing out. Sometimes my hands hurt so much that I couldn't hold silverware well enough to feed myself. <p>After four and a half years of conventional treatments did little or nothing to improve my condition, I decided that if I continued to follow the conventions dictated by the current medical model, I was unlikely to ever get well. </p><p>My graduate school training is in molecular biology at Washington University in St. Louis, one of the major medical research centers in the United States. I spent years researching the medical literature looking for effective ways to heal arthritis. I also explored and experimented with alternative medicine. </p><p>After 11 years of searching, I was eventually able to completely overcome my arthritic condition using the nine secrets detailed in my book. Each method provided a lasting and dramatic improvement in my condition. </p><p>After years of having difficulty walking from one room to another, I now walk many miles a week with ease and go on long bike rides for fun. I have regained full use of my hands and my hips. The pain and fatigue are gone. </p><p>The book I have written is the book I wish had been available when I first developed arthritis. It would have saved me years of pain and incapacitation. </p><p>It was through luck and perseverance that I eventually found ways to heal arthritis, even arthritis as severe as mine was. As you will find out in my book, many of these methods are well documented in the medical literature, but at the moment are just not well known. </p><p>I hope is that my book puts this information in the hands of those who need it the most. If you have arthritis, may it help you find your way back to health.</p></p><h2>NIV Spiritual Formation Bible</h2><p>- Helps people encounter God in a more personal and intimate way - Guides readers to experience God&#x2019;s presence through the senses, the imagination, and creative activity such as art and writing - Encourages Christians to meet God in seven areas: the Created Order, Everyday Life, Worship, Service, Prayer, Scripture, and Community - Also available in the New Revised Standard Translation</p><p>An Invitation to Intimacy with God A spiritual renaissance is taking place as believers rediscover the devotional disciplines that Christians have practiced for hundreds of years.

Their approach has helped shape everything from craftsmanship and ingenuity to concepts of communal living and work ethic. And while much of our modern-day fascination with the United Society of Shakers centers upon their unique attention to craftsmanship, the innovative spirit they brought to simple, Godly living is indeed the most timeless aspect of their legacy. From their earliest days, the Shakers have depended on innovations of every sort to secure their place in a world that was, initially, hostile to their so-called &#x201c;peculiar&#x201d; beliefs: community, celibacy, and primitive Christianity. These innovations included improvements, adaptations, refinements, and inventions. Inspired Innovations is the first book devoted to this widely acknowledged but long neglected aspect of Shakerism. A group of thirteen distinguished Shaker scholars, led by M. Stephen Miller, presents in this lavishly illustrated volume their research on the many &#x201c;zones&#x201d; of innovation that are considered here. Historians Scott T. Swank, Glendyne R. Wergland, and Stephen J. Paterwic &#x201c;set the table&#x201d; for a feast of words and images. The book features 350 full-color images, complete with descriptive captions and technical data.</p><p>M. STEPHEN MILLER has collected, written and lectured about, and organized exhibitions focused on the full range of Shaker endeavors for many years. The exhibit on which this book is based appears at the New Britain Museum of American Art, January through April 2010, and at Hancock Shaker Village, 2011. His collection of Shaker ephemera and small crafts is renowned. His most recent publication is From Shaker Lands and Shaker Hands, also published by University Press of New England."A quality look at the legendary craftsmanship of the Shaker nation."-- "Antique and Collectible News Service"<br><br>"Miller and several other experts have banded together to produce this definitive, profusely illustrated volume that sets straight the record about what the Shakers did invent, what they improved, what they refined, and how it all came about because of the Shaker way of life."-- "Maine Antique Digest"</p><h2>The Mind on Fire: An Anthology of the Writings of Blaise Pascal (CLASSICS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION)</h2><p>&#34;The Mind on Fire&#34; is predominantly a modern translation and editing of Blaise Pascal&#39;s &#34;Pensees&#34; along with a few other short works and a sampling of his letters. It is quite user-friendly and a good place to start when reading Pascal. Devotional reading, according to editor James Houston, is an important but neglected way of getting to know God. In today&#39;s microwave society, time-saving devices have not given us more time for contemplation but license to fill our days with even more activities. One cannot, however, get to know God in a hurry. It is in the spirit of contemplation that Multnomah offers its Classics of Faith and Devotion series. Blaise Pascal (1623-62) is perhaps best known for pithy sayings drawn from his works. For instance, Pascal declared, &#34;Atheists should say things that are perfectly clear. Yet it is not perfectly clear that the soul is only matter.&#34; Elsewhere he writes, &#34;Faith is a sounder guide than reason. Reason can go only so far, but faith has no limits.&#34; In 1654, at the age of 31, Pascal had what has been called an &#34;ecstatic experience.&#34; He described it simply as &#34;fire.&#34; He considered this his true point of conversion. Pascal&#39;s career as a Christian apologist and philosopher was short, but his influence continues. He has been considered by many &#34;the greatest of French prose writers.&#34; And today, though separated by time, space, and language, Pascal remains eminently quotable.</p><p></p><h2>THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH</h2><p>This book is a hardback volume.

Killed minutes before their wedding? <br>Heart pounding, Quinn pushed past Karen and hurried to the door, holding her skirt up enough so that she didn&#x2019;t trip, but otherwise unconcerned about what she might knock over on her way past. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she asked Frank as soon as she saw his face. <br>His eyes darted left and right. &#x201c;I need to talk to you privately.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is Burke dead?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What? <i>No!</i> No one&#x2019;s dead, there&#x2019;s just something I need to tell you about.&#x201d; <br>All of Quinn&#x2019;s anxiety immediately melted into disproportionate irritation. &#x201c;Really? Hm. I&#x2019;d love to chat, but maybe now isn&#x2019;t the best time. I&#x2019;m about to get married.&#x201d; <br>His expression hardened. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly why it has to be now.&#x201d; <br>Something about the way he said it, or maybe that granite set of his jaw, gave her pause. &#x201c;Fine. We&#x2019;ll go out the back door. There&#x2019;s probably no one out there. I don&#x2019;t want Burke to see me in my dress before the wedding, it&#x2019;s bad luck.&#x201d; <br>Frank made a derisive noise. <br>They stopped on the sidewalk a few yards outside the church and Frank said, &#x201c;I think you need to consider stopping the wedding. Or at least postponing it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You think I should stop the wedding now?&#x201d; she asked, vaguely aware of a hint of feeling, deep inside, that she&#x2019;d been waiting for something like this. Then, numb, afraid to hear the answer yet looking for it like a rubbernecker in traffic looks for severed limbs and decapitated heads at the scene of an accident even though those details could never be forgotten or less horrifying, she added, &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come on, Quinn, you <i>know</i> why. Surely you know why.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t! Tell me, specifically, <i>why</i>.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s <i>cheating</i> on you, that&#x2019;s why!&#x201d; Like she was stupid for asking. Like she already knew it, like <i>everyone</i> knew it, and he was just tired of watching her silly game. <br>She felt her hand go reflexively to her chest. What is that gesture? Why do people do it when they get a shock? To make sure they&#x2019;re still alive, that there&#x2019;s a heart beating under there, that they haven&#x2019;t died and gone to hell? <br>Because this revelation certainly made Quinn feel like she was in hell. Quite suddenly and unexpectedly. <br>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s not!&#x201d; <br> <i>Denial.</i> <br>&#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; she went on. Her voice was small. Childlike. But that didn&#x2019;t make him any gentler on her. <br>There was no compassion in his voice. &#x201c;He would and he did.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You want proof?&#x201d; <br> <i>Fear</i>. <br>What kind of proof? If it existed, would she want to see it? Or would that just be the kind of thing that, once seen, could never be forgotten and would gnaw at her forever? <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d; She swallowed and leveled her gaze on Frank. &#x201c;When did this supposedly happen?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Are you kidding, Quinn? You know he did. <i>Repeatedly!</i> Probably different girls. Probably even last night. Definitely in the last month. Does that answer your question enough?&#x201d; <br>It felt like she&#x2019;d been punched, hard, right in the gut. That&#x2019;s the clichï¿½, there&#x2019;s a reason for it. Felt like she&#x2019;d been punched in the gut. Shorthand for the myriad emotional, intellectual, and physical ramifications of being stunned. <br>Punched in the gut. <br>Except that was <i>exactly</i> how it felt&#x2014;the unexpected blow connecting to the solar plexus, forcing the air from her lungs, tripping her heartbeat, curving her shoulders over in the time-immemorial position of, <i>Stop! I give up! I can&#x2019;t take it!</i> <br> <i>Uncle!</i> <br> <i>No mas.</i> <br>In short, his words immobilized her. It was like crazy sci-fi technology in action&#x2014;he said it and she was instantly frozen into complete inaction at the very moment the church bells began to ring their call <i>to</i> action. <br> <i>It&#x2019;s true</i>, her most fearful inner voice said. <i>You know it&#x2019;s true</i>. But fear is such a liar, isn&#x2019;t it? Always there for you, louder than anything else inside, always pretending to be on your side. It&#x2019;s just looking out for you, right? <br>&#x201c;When <i>exactly</i>?&#x201d; she challenged, but she knew she wasn&#x2019;t going to like the answer. This wasn&#x2019;t fear she was talking to, or at least it wasn&#x2019;t fear who was going to answer, this was a real-life person who would <i>know</i>. Her hands tingled and she balled them into and out of fists as she paced on the sidewalk in front of him. <br>Frank. Francis Albert Morrison. Named, by his mother, after Frank Sinatra, despite his distinctly English ancestry and complete lack of creative talent, musical or otherwise. He wasn&#x2019;t a romantic either, or at least he&#x2019;d never demonstrated anything resembling that in the six years she had known him. Why he was suddenly Dustin Hoffman yelling, <i>Elaine!</i> at her would-be wedding, she didn&#x2019;t know. <br>Well, that wasn&#x2019;t quite fair. He wasn&#x2019;t yelling <i>Elaine!</i> He was yelling <i>Cheater!</i> Not <i>to</i> her but <i>at</i> her, and actually he wasn&#x2019;t even yelling it so much as he was <i>condescending</i> it, and he was talking about someone who, right up to that moment, had been her fiancï¿½. <br>Someone who, at that very moment, was waiting for her at the altar of the Middleburg United Methodist Church to become her husband. <br>Unless, of course, he was fucking her maid of honor behind the pulpit, which perhaps Frank would have her believe was equally likely. <br>Or which, god forbid, <i>was</i> equally likely. <br>&#x201c;Give me the details.&#x201d; Her knees went weak. She sank down onto the curb next to Frank and took off her wedding shoes. Her grandmother&#x2019;s wedding shoes. Something old. It took some effort. Her feet were dented and grooved where the material of the slightly small shoes had cut into her flesh, which had swollen in the heat and stress. <br>Later she realized that &#x201c;Give me the details&#x201d; are some of the most ill-advised words anyone can ever utter. Details <i>never</i> make anything better. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to say&nbsp;&#x2026; I can&#x2019;t do that to him&#x2026; <i>&#x201d;</i> <br>&#x201c; <i>Him?</i>&#x201d; she raged. As if he could just go this far and let her handle the rest on her own? <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t do it to <i>you</i> either. Maybe even <i>mostly</i> you.&#x201d; Like that made it better. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s none of my business at all, I&#x2019;m just trying to help you before you make the biggest mistake of your life <i>.&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;</i>Then <i>help</i> me! You cannot make this implication <i>while I&#x2019;m supposed to be walking down the aisle</i> and not tell me exactly what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d; <br>He looked pained, it had to be said. A good actor, or just a guy with a conscience? She didn&#x2019;t know. She realized, all in that one moment, that she&#x2019;d <i>never</i> known. Because she&#x2019;d actually always thought he was a good guy. Solid. Not one to whip up some sort of dangerous passion inside his soul and use it to potentially destroy someone else. <br>&#x201c; <i>Frank</i>.&#x201d; She stood and continued pacing in front of him even though her bare feet were killing her. Her feet always swelled when she got really stressed out. It was weird, but it was her <i>thing</i>. Maybe weirder since she wasn&#x2019;t really into shoes like her mom was. She&#x2019;d spent a lot of time barefoot as a teenager, pacing her feet into a size that, as her father always said, was better suited for the box than for the shoes that came in it. At this moment, every tiny pebble of the street pavement felt like it was cutting into her feet like glass, but she couldn&#x2019;t stop and try to wedge her Jurassic feet into her wedding pumps now. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you.&#x201d; <br>He looked surprised. Hurt? Maybe insulted, maybe just worried that she&#x2019;d dismiss something important. Ego or altruism, she didn&#x2019;t know. But he went forward boldly. &#x201c;I saw her <i>,&#x201d;</i> he said. &#x201c;I saw them. Together.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You saw her <i>,</i>&#x201d; she repeated dully. A foreign student learning the language by repeating. <br>He nodded. &#x201c;Yes. I saw her. <i>&#x201d;</i> <br>&#x201c; <i>And&#x2026;?</i>&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t want to know. She really, really didn&#x2019;t want to know. But she <i>had</i> to. She wanted every single awful detail. She was ready to hear it all and slice herself with each tiny detail again and again for the rest of her life, regretting it each and every time. &#x201c;Where? How? Elaborate!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A few times, she was at the farm <i>,</i>&#x201d; he began. <br>Her throat went so tight she nearly gagged. <br>Eight words that held so much. The shortest longest story ever told, at least to her. <br> <i>A few times</i> = there were too many to count. Not one single betrayal, possibly drunken, possibly mistaken, possibly&#x2014;somehow&#x2014;forgivable. <br> <i>A few times&nbsp;&#x2026; </i> <br>But, worse, <i>the farm</i> = <i>her</i> place. The place she loved more than any other. His family&#x2019;s farm went back generations. But she&#x2019;d been going there since she was fourteen, so it was part of <i>her</i> as well. She grew up in town, but Burke&#x2019;s family had a farm&#x2014;actually, it was a huge horse farm to her, ninety acres of the most beautiful rolling green hills you can imagine, with stables so pristine Thurston and Lovey Howell could&#x2019;ve moved right in. It was a place she&#x2019;d always loved. Middleburg was horse country, and, as a girl growing up, she&#x2019;d loved horses and always wanted one of her own. Her family weren&#x2019;t particularly wealthy, despite their zip code, so that dream remained an impossibility for her. <br>But when she&#x2019;d begun dating Burke at age fourteen&#x2014;which was still young enough to cling, if only in some vaguely subconscious way, to those childhood dreams and wishes&#x2014;the place might as well have been Disney World to her. <br>There was a five-page entry in her high school diary describing the farm from the first time he took her there. Every detail was still correct, from the ebony bookcases in the den to the crocheted bedspread in the guest room. And everything she wanted to change, on the day she was certain she would eventually move in, was also still in line with who she was and what she wanted. It seemed so much like fate. <br>It wasn&#x2019;t just a place to live out her childhood fantasies of horses and stables and whatever old <i>Spin and Marty</i> episodes were shown on <i>The Mickey Mouse Club</i> reruns they played on Channel Five. When Burke and she started to date and fall in love, it became <i>their place</i>. Burke and his grandfather and often his brother as well, would work around the place while Quinn would sit on the patio with his grandmother Dottie, drinking iced tea and hearing tales of the old days while the wind hushed across the long stretches of green nothingness that were increasingly rare in the D.C. suburbs. <br>The farm was sacred space. <br>Surely Frank knew how much it would hurt her to bring this up this way. Surely he wouldn&#x2019;t do it if he didn&#x2019;t think he <i>had</i> to&nbsp;&#x2026; would he? <br>&#x201c;He took her <i>there</i>?&#x201d; she said. Her voice sounded so much stronger than she felt. Her throat was so tight she felt like someone was strangling her, yet it sounded like she had the conviction and anger appropriate to a woman who has found out, <i>just in the nick of time</i>, that she&#x2019;s been betrayed. She&#x2019;d ask the questions she had to ask, even though she didn&#x2019;t want the answers. She <i>needed</i> the answers, and she&#x2019;d get them. She was a detective, she was fucking Columbo or something, with a pretend pad and pen in her hand, saying, <i>And what, exactly, do you know about that?</i> <br>&#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t want to say more. You know enough. Ask him now. How could he deny it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Apparently he has for some time!&#x201d; <br>Frank shook his head. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t betray him anymore, it goes against Guy Code.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Fuck Guy Code!</i>&#x201d; How could anyone look at a woman in the pain she knew was contorting her face and burning in her eyes, and think it was sufficient to give a small, yet powerful, detail without follow-up? &#x201c;What. Else. Do. You. Know. About. Her?&#x201d; <br>Long pause. <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a stoner,&#x201d; he finally said with a shrug, though his tone was one of disgust. <br>Ah. <br>That should make her feel better. <br>She was lesser than Quinn, because Quinn wasn&#x2019;t a stoner. Quinn was the opposite. How comforting. She was totally anti-stoner. But so was Burke! Burke was as straight and narrow as they came! She&#x2019;d never seen him have anything stronger than a beer, and he usually opted for milk at that. <br>Yet he&#x2019;d taken some stoner chick to the farm and banged her there? This was either a huge flaw in Frank&#x2019;s story or it was the detail that dropped the <i>Price Is Right</i> Plinko chip into the $5,000 slot of her lingering doubt about Burke&#x2019;s faithfulness. <br>Her throat tingled and she thought she might pass out, a big white unidentifiable splash in the street gutter that people wouldn&#x2019;t even slow down before running over. <br> <i>What was that? A sack of sweet feed?</i> <br>She straightened, with some effort in the now-ridiculous dress, and tried to breathe and walk off the shaking that emanated from a spot in the center of her being. <br>Her heart. <br>Then Frank delivered his final blow, which she&#x2019;d never have time to figure out whether it was an incredibly clever manipulation via lies-so-weird-they-had-to-be-true or just truth-is-stranger-than-fiction. <br>&#x201c;Actually, she got stoned there with Rob.&#x201d; He looked at her earnestly, his wavy dark hair short and controlled just like his demeanor, versus Burke&#x2019;s wild mane. And Frank&#x2019;s eyes were a serious amber brown, in contrast to Burke&#x2019;s heartthrobby blue. <br>It made Frank easier to believe somehow. <br>He considered for a moment before adding&#x2014;as redemption for Burke?&#x2014;a lame, &#x201c;That did piss Burke off.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But&#x2026; <i>&#x201d;</i> Her mind couldn&#x2019;t compute. Couldn&#x2019;t make sense of this. Couldn&#x2019;t do the math. Yet couldn&#x2019;t stop trying. Rain Man trying to add every single number in the phone book. Rob was a hired hand who&#x2019;d moved out, what, a year ago? <i>Ages</i> ago. It was weird enough to say that Burke had somehow condoned this, but adding the detail&#x2014;Rob&#x2014;that conceivably had credibility <i>and</i> the vague insinuation of a time frame&nbsp;&#x2026; well, honestly, she just would never have given Frank credit for being that creative. He was <i>very</i> smart, but in a left-brain, numbers sort of way. <br>Weaving these perfect, weird details for her just seemed out of his league. <br>Hell, it was even out of <i>her</i> league, and she was what she would normally consider a fairly wily woman. <br>&#x201c;But he hates&#x2026; <i>,</i>&#x201d; she tried, then lost her voice. Or her point. <br>Or her soul. <br>This just sounded too true, if only in its very falseness. It didn&#x2019;t matter what Burke hated or approved of, maybe there had even been some perverse fetishish pleasure in going for someone deliberately opposite Quinn. Still, it was the timing that stung like lashes from a whip. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bee...</p><h2>Skinner of Skinner&#39;s Horse: A fictional portrait</h2><p>Dust jacket has a faded spine and short tears to edges, page edges tanned.

Brett wildly charged out of the dugout and chaos ensued. The call temporarily cost the Royals the game, but the decision was eventually overturned, resulting in a resumption of the game several weeks later that created its own hysteria.<br> <br><i>The Pine Tar Game</i> chronicles this watershed moment, marking a pivot in the sport, when benign cheating tactics, like spitballs, Superball bats, and a couple extra inches of tar on an ash bat, gave way to era of soaring salaries, labor struggles, and rampant use of performance-enhancing drugs. Filip Bondy paints a portrait of the Yankees and Royals of that era, featuring two diametrically opposed owners, in George Steinbrenner and Ewing Kauffman; a host of bad actors and phenomenal athletes; and lots of yelling. Players and club officials like Brett, Goose Gossage, Willie Randolph, Ron Guidry, Sparky Lyle, David Cone, and John Schuerholz offer fresh commentary on the events along with their take on a rivalry that culminated in one of the most iconic baseball tantrums of all time. Rush Limbaugh, employed by the Royals at the time as a promotions director, offers his own insider&#x2019;s perspective. Through this one fateful game, the ensuing protest, and ultimate fallout, <i>The Pine Tar Game </i>examines a more innocent time in professional sports, as well as the shifting tide that gave us today&#x2019;s modern iteration of baseball.</p><p>Filip Bondy has been a sports columnist for the <i>Daily News</i> (New York) for more than twenty years, regularly covering&nbsp;the Olympics, World Cup, and Wimbledon. Before that, he was an Olympics writer for <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>. Some of Bondy&#x2019;s previous books include a look at the watershed NBA draft (<i>Tip Off</i>) and a lighthearted view of the worst players in Major League Baseball history (<i>Who&#x2019;s on Worst?</i>).The Pine Tar Game Introduction<p></p> <br>The story begins, as all the best ones do, with a bat and a ball. The tale is layered with rules, with politics, with tantrums, with a David and Goliath rivalry, with judicial procedures, with Roy Cohn working for one side and Rush Limbaugh for the other, with deep, lasting friendships and with strong, quirky ballpark personalities. But the saga of the Pine Tar Game centers on a Hillerich &amp; Bradsby model T (for Marv Throneberry)&#x2013;85 Louisville Slugger, 341/2 inches long, 32 ounces in weight. Some players, as Pete Rose once did, constantly fiddle with bats during their careers, changing models, lengths, and weights as often as they do their socks. They create hybrid models, mutants. Others, like Derek Jeter, retain the same design and weight for every game they play. Jeter swung the P-72 Louisville Slugger for 20 years with the Yankees. The T-85 was George Brett&#x2019;s model and the pine tar bat was his favorite T-85, ever. The bat now rests inside a glass display case in Cooperstown. Some of the pine tar has been scraped off, or worn off. Look closely and you&#x2019;ll see a red line where that nasty stuff once rose to a level deemed sinful by the umpires, until it wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>The bat was a small botanical miracle, just seven grains of ash. &#x201c;You look at these grains now, maybe, a good bat might be a 10-, 11-, 12-grainer, a normal bat would be 13, 14, 15 grains going through it,&#x201d; George Brett says. &#x201c;But this one had seven, which meant it was really, really hard.&#x201d; Brett had a contact at Hillerich &amp; Bradsby, a fellow he knew only as Tiny. Tiny would look out for the Kansas City Royals&#x2019; third baseman, search the lumber for the very best stock. He manufactured this bat for Brett, and then Tiny marked red stars on top of the knots, which highlighted the hardest parts of the wood. This Louisville Slugger would not snap or splinter easily, not like those maple toothpicks that shatter today at the first sight of a cut fastball.<br> <br>In 1983, almost all the bats were still Louisville Sluggers, made from ash trees. Since then, an epidemic of emerald ash borers&#x2014;an Asian beetle invasion&#x2014;has hurt the stock. Besides, a lot of ballplayers simply decided they preferred maple, which is a heavier, harder, smoother wood with thinner grains; or even birch wood, a compromise material. Nathan Stalvey, curator at the Louisville Slugger factory and museum, estimates that the percent of ash bats used in the major leagues has dipped in the past few decades from about 95 percent to 40 percent. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby&#x2019;s share of the market has also slipped substantially, because of globalization and player endorsements. The Louisville company that once held a monopoly on bats must now share the market with 32 other manufacturers, including Rawlings, Mizuno, Old Hickory, Trinity, and Chandler. Only about 30 percent of the bats in major league games are now produced by Hillerich &amp; Bradsby. Brett kept his own precious bat unvarnished, raw. &#x201c;I just liked the way it felt, liked the way it looked,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Plain, tempered, raw ash, that came out real white.&#x201d; But plain only went so far. He kept applying more of a sticky hydrocarbon substance, made from the stumps of pine trees, for a better grip. He was one of the few players then or now who never wore batting gloves, preferring bare hands on raw bat. Brett was also one of only a few hitters to use so much pine tar. Great batters like Pete Rose and Ted Williams preferred their bats much tidier. Both would douse their bats daily in wood alcohol. Brett was a bat slob, and is the first to admit it. &#x201c;What happens in my case is the pine tar gets in the grain and starts growing inside,&#x201d; Brett says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just caked on the bat, it&#x2019;s kind of growing inside the grain. As a result of using a bat for three or four weeks and putting pine tar on three, four times a day, it&#x2019;s gonna get pretty ugly. And the bat was pretty ugly. But it was still working.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was working very well on Sunday, July 24, 1983, the finale of a tight, four-game series in the Bronx. The Yanks had taken two of the first three games and were within spitting distance of winning the fourth when Brett knocked a ripping fastball from Goose Gossage over the right-field wall at Yankee Stadium. The home run arrived with two outs and one runner on base in the ninth inning, the Yanks up, 4&#x2013;3, and with the best reliever in baseball about to close out a save against the pesky, small-market rivals. Suddenly, the Royals were ahead, 5&#x2013;4. And then, just as suddenly, they weren&#x2019;t, which is when the story of the baseball itself comes into play.<br> <br>This was a different time, and the economics of Major League Baseball were considerably more modest. While George Steinbrenner was relatively extravagant in all eras, he was still spending only $13 million total on his player payroll in 1983, about $40 million in 2015 dollars. The Yankees are now forever flirting with a $200&#x2013;$225 million payroll, more than five times as great, not always with wonderful results. Brett, a veteran superstar, was earning $1 million with the Royals. At this juncture, it was still possible for a merely wealthy man to own a baseball team. He didn&#x2019;t have to be a billionaire or a conglomerate. One such owner, a famous miser, was Calvin Griffith, who took over the Washington Senators in 1955, moved them to Minnesota in 1961 as the Twins, and held on to the reins until 1984. Griffith was a cantankerous man, who unfortunately remains best known for explaining in 1978 why he relocated his team to Minneapolis: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you why we came to Minnesota,&#x201d; the Canadian-born owner told a local Lions Club. &#x201c;It was when we found out you only had 15,000 blacks here. Black people don&#x2019;t go to ballgames, but they&#x2019;ll fill up a rassling ring and put up such a chant it&#x2019;ll scare you to death. We came here because you&#x2019;ve got good, hardworking white people here.&#x201d; The poor Lions at the meeting left the place understandably disturbed. One businessman told a Minneapolis Star Tribune reporter, &#x201c;I can see why he has trouble with some of his players after listening to him talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>Again, this was a different time, and such ignorant speech did not disqualify Griffith from owning the Twins, or even earn him a suspension. Over the years, Griffith became thoroughly annoyed at the costs of running a franchise and began to micromanage his team&#x2019;s budget in much the same way as Charlie Finley with the A&#x2019;s. Among his pet peeves was that the Twins were exhausting more than their designated allotment of baseballs in games, replacing dirty ones with fresh ones too often. By today&#x2019;s standards, the baseballs then were being mightily overused, because now they are directly tossed into the dugout at a pitcher&#x2019;s discretion, or whenever they so much as touch the dirt. Not so long ago, a pitcher dissatisfied with a seam or the slickness of a baseball would have to relay it for inspection to the umpire, who might reject the plea and throw the old ball right back into play. Griffith began to look into the causes of soiled baseballs and discovered that many were stained by contact with dirt on bats. In particular, contact with that sticky, contagious black pine tar. As Lee MacPhail, president of the American League, confirmed in 2003, &#x201c;The clubs were losing a lot of balls because the pine tar was getting on them, and they&#x2019;d have to be thrown out in batting practice and everything else.&#x201d; If only pine tar were white, like the accessible rosin bags that pitchers use before gripping the baseball, this would never have become an issue. Rosin was just fine for pitchers, even encouraged. Pine tar was a different story&#x2014;as starter Michael Pineda of the Yankees discovered in April 2014, when he was caught with a strip of the dark substance on his neck and tossed from a game against the Red Sox in Boston.<br> <br>Back in 1976, Griffith retained considerable influence with the rules committee and, aided by other skinflint owners, was able to push through Rule 1.10 (c), which stated, in passive-aggressive fashion, &#x201c;The bat handle, for not more than 18 inches from its end, may be covered or treated with any material or substance to improve the grip. Any such material, including pine tar, which extends past the 18-inch limitation, in the umpire&#x2019;s judgment, shall cause the bat to be removed from the game. No such material shall improve the reaction or distance factor of the bat.&#x201d;<br> <br>The issue was complicated, however, and interpretations murky. There were two related rules that possibly could render a ball struck by an illegal bat an illegal hit. Or not. There were gray areas, and contradictory precedents. The pine tar rule actually had some organic roots in the Big Bang beginnings of baseball. The origins of the decree, and that 18-inch mark, can be traced all the way back to 1885. According to baseball historian John Thorn, a rule was then put into place stating, &#x201c;The handle of the bat may be wound with twine not to exceed 18 inches from the end.&#x201d; The next year, 1886, another statute was added to deal with such gritty stuff as rosin and dirt: &#x201c;A granulated substance may be applied to the bat handle not to exceed 18 inches from the end.&#x201d; In 1893, this same rule was modified a bit, into, &#x201c;The bat must be made wholly of hard wood except that the handle may be wound with twine, or a granulated substance applied, not to exceed 18 inches from the end.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was then refined, yet again: &#x201c;The bat shall be round, not over 23/4 inches in diameter at the thickest part, not more than 42 inches in length, and entirely of hard, solid wood in one piece. Twine may be wound around it or a granulated substance applied to it, for a distance of 18 inches from the end of the handle, but not elsewhere.&#x201d;<br> <br>For decades, that sufficed. The 18-inch margin never changed. There was no denying, however, that baseballs were getting dirtier faster, and concern had grown in the sport about discolored, hard-to-spot baseballs ever since Ray Chapman was killed by a soil-camouflaged fastball from Carl Mays in 1920. Some batters used a combination of rosin and pine tar for a better grip. Others, most famously Stan Musial, would apply beeswax to the handle. When it became fashionable during the 1950s to wrap the handle of bats with adhesive tape (every kid&#x2019;s sandlot bat in that era was swathed in black tape), the Playing Rules Committee enacted more specific modifications in 1954: &#x201c;The bat shall be a smooth, rounded stick not more than 23/4 inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length. The bat shall be one piece of solid wood or formed from a block of wood consisting of two or more pieces of wood bonded together with an adhesive in such a way that the grain direction of all pieces is essentially parallel to the length of the bat. Any such laminated bat shall contain only wood or adhesive, except for a clear finish. For a distance of 18 inches from the end by which the bat is gripped, it may be roughened or wrapped with tape or twine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ergo, the origin of it all, the primordial ooze that begat one of the most absurd, most entertaining baseball games in major league history. Or maybe it was two games, depending on how you look at it.<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>No sporting event is played exclusively outside some degree of social context. The year 1983 was a particularly apprehensive time in New York City, fraught with fears over the spread of a relatively new plague, AIDS. By the end of the year, more than 850 New Yorkers were known to have died from the disease, which was still not understood at all. Could it be spread by close contact in large crowds? By public toilet seats at ballparks? Mayor Ed Koch, serving the sixth year of his 12-year term, seemed curiously uninterested in the growing epidemic. The administration had spent a grand total of $24,500 on the subject. Two New York gays, Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz, published a book, How to Have Sex in an Epidemic, considered somewhat reckless at this stage by many doctors.<br> <br>In Kansas City, the impact of this disease was yet to be felt in full. Instead, the city was immersed in a fiscal battle with its Missouri neighbors over school busing and desegregation, hoping to end a pattern of white flight to the suburbs by creating an attractive magnet system within its borders. The battle was eventually lost and cost a small fortune. Kansas City was also fighting a more stereotypical, outsider&#x2019;s view of the place that it was good for ribs, barbecue sauce, and little else. There was a lot of bad news to deal with in the early eighties, the worst of which was the walkway collapse at the Hyatt Regency on July 17, 1981, which killed 114 people and injured 200 more. That tragedy became something of a symbol for the crumbling infrastructure of the inner city. So these were not easy times for either metropolis, but the cities&#x2019; baseball teams could always supply some small relief. This game on July 24, 1983, would provide the sort of escapist fun and debate badly required by all. It would also sell newspapers, never a bad thing at any time.<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>I was there in the press box at Yankee Stadium when it happened, when Brett went nuts. Honest. I got one of those &#x201c;I Covered the Pine Tar Game&#x201d; T-shirts handed out to the Yankee beat writers by the team&#x2019;s playful public relations director, Ken Nigro&#x2014;though I don&#x2019;t for the life of me know what happened to that precious relic. My wife probably threw it out, as she does many other things, which is her only bad habit. At the time, I was the beat writer for the Bergen Record in Hackensack, New Jersey, and about to accept a job with the New York Daily News sports department for more money to support a young family. This was a big career transition for me, and when researching this book it became a bit of an inconvenience. To read my coverage of the game, and my take on Lee MacPhail&#x2019;s surprising decision to replay the final inning, I went through a reel of microfiche in Hackensack&#x2019;s Johnson Library for old Record articles. But to retrieve my stories on the court proceedings and the actual replay that followed, I needed to pester helpful Daily News library researchers for copies of the yellowed clippings.<br> <br>Those articles told of a very different era, of course. The relationship between the media and the baseball teams in New York was just beginning to turn adversarial. I recall being on the road with the Yankees in 1983, having a beer with Mike McAlary of the New York Post and Bill &#x201c;Killer&#x201d; Kane, traveling secretary for the club. Kane was lamenting how we all used to be partners in this business, and how the reporters had changed that with their intrusive, negative coverage. There was no going back, however. The Yankee Stadium press box then was the center of the sports universe&#x2014;the communications nexus between George Steinbrenner and the public that he so desperately wished to convince about one ridiculous matter or another. Reporters like Murray Chass and Joe Durso of the New York Times, McAlary and Henry Hecht of the New York Post, Bill Madden and Phil Pepe of the Daily News, and Moss Klein of the Newark Star-Ledger would spend great lengths of time in the locker room named after longtime equipment manager Pete Sheehy. They would chat with players and listen to Billy Martin rant in his office about some slight perpetrated upon him by an umpire or imagined enemy. On his better days, Martin would share some of his tactical insight, his genius, and make us remember why anybody bothered to put up with him. Having completed this pregame ritual, we would carry our clunky, primitive computers from the basement press room to the elevato...</p><h2>The Great Persuasion: Reinventing Free Markets Since the Depression</h2><p>Title: The Great Persuasion( Reinventing Free Markets Since the Depression) Binding: Hardcover Author: AngusBurgin Publisher: HarvardUniversityPress</p><p>Angus Burgin is Assistant Professor of History at Johns Hopkins University.A brilliant rereading of the history of modern conservative thought, which casts each of its key protagonists in new light. The line from Friedrich Hayek to Milton Friedman was no straightforward unfolding of constant neoliberal premises, but a crooked path full of contradictions, contention, and unexpected contingencies. (Daniel T. Rodgers, author of <i>Age of Fracture</i>)<br><br>Burgin has written a marvelous account of the role of the Mont Pï¿½lerin Society in transforming public discourse concerning the role of markets in society. His meticulously researched, clear-eyed, and nuanced treatment is a compelling and well-told story. (Bruce Caldwell, author of <i>Hayek's Challenge: An Intellectual Biography of F.A. Hayek</i>)<br><br><i>The Great Persuasion</i> is an exemplary work of intellectual history showing how a small circle of theorists played a huge role in the triumph and persistence of market-centered political conservatism. Burgin renders refreshingly dynamic the notoriously dreary ideas of economists as he narrates two generations of calculated networking, skillful popularization, and political organizing. (David A. Hollinger, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br>John Maynard Keynes famously insisted that ideas, not interests, matter in history. In this tremendously accomplished study, Burgin shows how a few men and their ideas exploded Keynes's own welfarist orthodoxy. And yet perhaps even Keynes would welcome the results, for ultimately Burgin suggests that no ideology, including the romance of the free market that rules today, is invulnerable to those who insist that it is wrong. (Samuel Moyn, author of <i>The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History</i>)<br><br>Burgin tells the story of free market theory in a masterful intellectual history that covers the 1930s to the 1970s. Keynes and the Keynesians declared laissez-faire over and done in the 1930s, Burgin observes, but 50 years later, free market economics had revived... Burgin traces the development of the principles that challenged Keynes and statism&#x2014;and still do&#x2014;dwelling on the profound impact of Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman. He describes the astonishing and unexpected popular success of Hayek's The Road to Serfdom and traces Milton Friedman's role in popularizing free market economics... Burgin covers a complex subject clearly and free of cant. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2012-08-31)<br><br>Offers a concise account of how F.A. Hayek and later Milton Friedman disseminated the virtues of free markets and enlivened conservatism in Britain and the United States, culminating in the triumphs of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. (Kenneth Minogue <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2012-10-26)<br><br>One of the great merits of <b>Burgin</b>'s book is to show how the character and the content of the free-market ideology changed when the flag passed from Hayek and Company to Friedman and Company. Despite the efforts of a small band of the faithful, the Tea Party is, and is likely to remain, more Friedman than Hayek: harder-line, more brashly confident, less concerned with getting things quite right, and without sympathy for losers. (Robert M. Solow <i>New Republic</i> 2012-11-16)<br><br>A riveting cultural-political history of the free-market revival that began even as depression and world war threatened to quench the last embers of laissez-faire. <b>Burgin</b>--an insightful scholar rather than an apologist--pays special attention to the role of the Mt. Pelerin Society in the postwar conservative and classical-liberal story. (Daniel McCarthy <i>American Spectator</i> 2012-12-05)<br><br><b>Burgin</b> never reveals whether he personally thinks Mises, Hayek, or Friedman were intellectually right or wrong (Mises, he insists, was tactically a little rigid and extreme). Instead, he focuses on how they built (or failed to build) relationships, networks, and institutions; how they funded and organized projects like the Mount Pelerin Society, which lies at the heart of his story; and how personality, ideas, even geography drew confederates closer together, then blew them apart. Burgin is a quiet connoisseur of the ironic shift, the subtle change in ideas under new conditions, the intellectual difference exposing larger conflicts...He understands and outlines the often complex interplay of ideas in rarefied academic centers, how ideas cross-fertilize and mutate as generations pass and conditions change. This book would be valuable if only for his careful dissection of ideas by mostly forgotten Chicago economists like Jacob Viner and Frank Knight in the decades before Friedman...Burgin offers intellectual biographies of many of the key members of Mount Pelerin, from the society's contentious early administrator Albert Hunold to luminaries such as Karl Popper, Michael Oakeshott, Michael Polanyi, and George Stigler." (Robert Teitelman <i>New York Journal of Books</i> 2012-10-30)<br><br>Many people, cheerleaders and detractors alike, have made careers flapping their mouths about the meaning of postwar conservatism without bothering to acquire half the understanding of it that <b>Burgin</b> has...He loves economics and its arguments and rivalries enough to have mastered a pile of minutes, monographs, and personal correspondence and turned it all into a great ideological drama. He has written a terrific book. Original and judicious, it never loses sight of the philosophical arguments economics conceals, sometimes accidentally, sometimes on purpose.

Thomas Bewick's <i>History of British Birds </i>marked the moment, the first "field guide" for ordinary people, illustrated with woodcuts of astonishing accuracy and beauty. But his work was far more than a mere guide,<br>for in the vivid vignettes scattered through the book, Bewick captured the vanishing world of rural English life. In this superb biography, Jenny Uglow tells the story of the farmer's son from Tyneside who influenced book illustration for a century to come. It is a story of violent change, radical politics, lost ways of life, and the beauty of the wild--a journey to the beginning of our lasting obsession with the natural world.</p><p><b>Jenny Uglow</b> is an editor at Chatto &amp; Windus and lives in Canterbury, England. Her previous books include <i>A Little History of British Gardening</i> (FSG, 2004); <i>The Lunar Men</i> (FSG, 2002), winner of the PEN International Prize for History; and <i>Hogarth</i> (FSG, 1997).Prologue: A Plain Man's Art&nbsp;Printing from woodblocks is the oldest way of all. Before Gutenberg invented moveable type around 1450, books and broadsheets were produced by writing the text on wood in reverse, as in a mirror, and then cutting painstakingly round the letters, dabbing the block with ink and pressing paper on top. With the new metal type, printers still used the blocks for illustrations and a single block could be used over and over again, on different pages, in different books. The early cutters worked on the 'side-grain' of the wood, a plank cut along the trunk, often of a fruitwood such as pear or cherry, using carpenters' tools - knives, chisels and gouges. When designed by masters like Dï¿½rer or Holbein these woodcuts could attain an astounding delicacy, but increasingly book publishers preferred to use copper engravings which gave a finer effect, and the crude woodcuts were banished to broadsides and chapbooks. Slowly, however, craftsmen tried using the dense end-grain of wood, sliced across the trunk or branch rather than along it like a plank. Boxwood proved the best, because box grows so slowly that the growth-lines are very close and on its hard surface the engravers could use the fine tools employed on silver or copper.&nbsp;Bewick worked on boxwood, sent up in logs by sea from London. Hundreds of his woodblocks still survive, their scenes as sharp as the day he cut them. When I began writing, I went to see Iain Bain, a great Bewick expert. Outside his book-room rain clouds gathered and drops hung from the washing line; inside, the air smelled of leather bindings, ink and linseed oil. From a drawer Iain took a blackened wood block, its fret of thin lines shining in the light and its bark still rough around the edges, and fixed it in the bed of an old hand-press, ready to be inked. On the windowsill were pots of ink so thick that the roller made a slick, slick sound as he dabbed it on the block. The methods and materials were those of Bewick's time: vellum skins for the press tympans - the frame that holds down the sheet for printing - fine woollen blankets to pad them and carefully damped paper. After we ran the bed of the press under the heavy plate, I pulled the lever firmly, to lower the plate with a slight 'dwell' on blankets, paper and block. Then we ran the press back, raised the covers and gently peeled off the paper, holding it up like washerwomen about to peg it on the line. And there it was. &nbsp;Before me was a tiny scene, not a lyrical country lane but a man pissing against a wall - perhaps a fragment of Hadrian's Wall, not far across the Tyne from where Bewick grew up. But was the print good enough? We took another impression, and there was the man again, still casting his shadow on the stones - and there he will be time after time, whenever the block is printed, but every time slightly different. Iain pored over the print to discover what adjustment of pressure, weight of ink or dampness of paper might be needed for a better result. And each impression made me hold my breath. I wanted the perfect print, showing every minute detail, all within the compass of two inches: the variations in his shadow and the arc of his pee, the socks rolling down below broad calves, the widely planted feet and the curve of his back, with the wrinkle in his coat between the shoulders; the tilt of his head and hat as he looks down, the roll of possessions flung down behind him. The wind is from the west, the trees lean and the grasses flow with the gusts towards the stream. But who is this man, and where is he walking? His stick hangs from a branch, and beyond him a wattle fence leads by the edge of the wood, past tufts of waving grass towards a just-glimpsed horizon.&nbsp;This woodcut, typically, has no border. Bewick left his vignettes open, as if leaving us free to make our own reading and go on our way. But while his scenes free us they also hold and absorb us. Images like the man by the wall were merely tailpieces - or tale-pieces as he punningly called them - cut by candlelight after a day's work and used to fill empty spaces at the end of a page. They look unassuming but command attention. They ask us to look deep, as children stare at illustrations when they first start to read, drawn into the pictured world. No wonder that Bewick began his career by illustrating books for children. There are hundreds of such scenes: boys flying kites, sailing boats on puddles, tumbling off carts; women chasing geese; men mending nets; old soldiers in unheroic rags; fishermen tangling their line in the trees. Together these scenes make a world, and this book describes the life of the man who created it - an impression, at least, off a Bewick block.&nbsp;*&nbsp;Only the wealthy could afford the grand natural history books with their lavish copper engravings, but Bewick's woodcuts were far cheaper and this made his books far more widely available. We are now used to good printed images, colour photographs and astounding natural history films, but if we imagine a time when there were hardly any accurate images of animals and birds, we can begin to feel the amazed thrill of recognition at Bewick's affectionate woodcuts of familiar animals like the field mouse or sheepdog, or the birds of the fields and the woods. Wood engravings were the plain man's art, dismissed by the critic Horace Walpole in a cursory footnote in 1782 as 'slovenly stamps', but Bewick transformed them into images of haunting depth and subtlety. He was a powerful and passionate man, and his woodcuts carry the intensity of his feelings about the landscape and its creatures and his wry affection for the Northumbria he loved. In this book, nearly all the vignettes are the same size as he printed them: where this is not so the illustration list explains that they are reduced. It is tempting to enlarge them, as some lines are so fine that they could have been drawn with a needle. But their miniature intensity is, paradoxically, part of their greatness, and this way, too, they appear as their first readers saw them, the tailpieces floating without captions in the text. &nbsp;In early May 1825, near Helpston in Northamptonshire, the poet John Clare saw a small brown bird that he could not identify. Did anyone, he asked his friend Joseph Henderson, have a copy of Bewick's Birds? All lovers of birds in these years looked to Bewick. He spoke directly to men like Clare, a former farm worker and lime burner who knew every inch of the fields around his home, and to Henderson, head gardener at the nearby hall. Bewick was in his sixties by then, but he came from the same world as them, growing up on a smallholding in the Tyne valley and spending his adult days in a busy jobbing workshop in Newcastle: he would rather be herding sheep upon Mickley fell, he told a friend in middle age, than live in London and be Premier of England. Nothing hurt him more than the enclosure acts that drove the cottagers from the common.&nbsp;He was a plain, no-nonsense man, who worked in a brown silk cap to hide a bald patch, wore worsted stockings, spoilt his children and went to the pub in the evening. Bluff and direct, warm to his friends and often generous to the point of foolishness, he was a shrewd businessman, brisk with apprentices, cussed in quarrels, stubborn in holding a grudge. But he also possessed an extraordinary talent and his skill has never been surpassed. He was knowing, too, about the mystery of art, the strange process of transferring a scene into a two-dimensional web of lines. One small vignette shows a cottage almost obscured by a fingerprint. &nbsp;This is Bewick's mark, drawing attention to the maker. But it is also a clever way of reminding us just how tiny this work of art is: though full of detail it can be covered by a finger. The story is hidden - all we can see is that someone is riding into the shadow, towards the cottage. And where is the viewer standing? Perhaps, as one critic has suggested, we are looking through a window, the glass smudged by a passing hand? The image is simple yet playfully ambiguous.&nbsp;Bewick's own story - sometimes funny, sometimes tragic - seems to demand a simple telling, cradle-to-grave, old-fashioned style. Yet the flow of his life, like all our lives, was shaped by the broad currents of the time. Different stories run together and intermingle. One is the tale of the workshop and the apprentices. Another is that of the book trade, of how children learned to read through images, how printers and booksellers worked and how the revival of wood engraving fostered the great illustrations of Punch and the novels of Dickens. A third describes the fierce political struggles during a time of almost constant war and change. Another strand is the story of Britain's 'Natural History Revolution', as John Rayner put it, 'parallel with, but less noticed than, the Industrial Revolution'. In Bewick's day, the fieldwork of amateur naturalists was just beginning to lay the foundations for modern ecology. As he worked on his books, landowners and vicars, farmers and sea captains sent him birds, both alive and dead, piling on his workbench. He was a fine naturalist himself, and his work combined keen, detailed observation with a new approach, showing animals and birds in their natural settings, as part of the whole great interrelated web of nature. 'Nature' and God fused together in Bewick's vision, as a rolling force that infused every aspect of life, from the habits of an ant to the vastness of the universe, 'this sublime, this amazing, this mighty work of Suns &amp; Worlds innumerable'. He felt its darkness as well as its beauty and his work touched the dawning Romantic age: Wordsworth was among the first to sing his praises and Charlotte Brontï¿½ placed his prints of icy seas in the hands of her young heroine, Jane Eyre. &nbsp;The nation's love affair with nature was a reaction to the way that the country itself...</p><h2>Wolverine 2: Killable</h2><p>The biggest Wolverine event in years starts here!

From the various circuits that capital and money go through and their interactions, to different costs of maintenance of capital and its mobility, Marx goes to extreme detail to describe circulation of capital. &#39;</p><p><b>Karl Marx</b> was born in 1818 in Trier, Germany and studied in Bonn and Berlin. Influenced by Hegel, he later reacted against idealist philosophy and began to develop his own theory of historical materialism. He related the state of society to its economic foundations and mode of production, and recommended armed revolution on the part of the proletariat. Together with Engels, who he met in Paris, he wrote the Manifesto of the Communist Party. He lived in England as a refugee until his death in 1888, after participating in an unsuccessful revolution in Germany.

Yet lurking behind the scenes is a host of personages who long ago selected this man to forward their global agenda. FRONTMAN reveals the actual powers behind his throne: Bilderberg plotters, Zionist handlers, global financiers and Marxist activists. Critics have called Obama an empty suit, but in actuality, the suit is filled by a cabal of men and women whose primary goal is to radically transform the United States. To cover their tracks, an air of secrecy has enveloped Obama&#39;s past, including his birth records, college transcripts and employment history. While other books merely scratch the surface, FRONTMAN tears away the deceptive smoke and mirrors that have been used to propel him into the Oval Office. By far the most comprehensive expose to date, President Barack Obama can no longer hide behind a facade that has been carefully created and orchestrated over the past few decades by people who are still pulling his strings. The title says it all: America&#39;s commander-in-chief is merely a figurehead for much more powerful people and forces. Now, at long last, one of the most brutally honest portraits ever presented shows how our nation is being controlled by unseen hands that are leading us perilously close to disaster.</p><p>Victor Thorn founded Sisyphus Press in the fall of 2000, and is the author of fifteen books, as well as twelve other chapbooks.

However, a course in creative crime writing became the trigger to a drastic change of career. She's written seven novels so far and they were all No 1 bestsellers across Scandinavia. She lives in a suburb of Stockholm with her three children.</p>Long troubled by her late mother&#x2019;s coldness toward her two daughters, writer Erica Falck begins to read her mother, Elsy&#x2019;s, teenage diaries. She also discovers a Nazi war medal with the diaries and asks a retired history teacher to examine it. Within days, the teacher is bludgeoned to death. Then Britta, Elsy&#x2019;s closest friend as a teenager, who is suffering from Alzheimer&#x2019;s, is also murdered. Through the diaries, Erica intuits that the solution to the mystery is rooted in events that took place during WWII. Once again, Lï¿½ckberg (The Stonecutter, 2012) employs Swedish history and her setting, Fjallbacka, the postcard-pretty village where Falck grew up, to craft an engaging tale that spans three generations of Fjallbackians. The author goes deep into the lives of a very large cast of characters, and some crime lovers might balk at a 520-plus&#x2013;page novel that is almost half family saga. But taken as a whole, The Hidden Child will keep fans of Swedish crime guessing until the final pages. --Thomas Gaughan</p><h2>The Grandees: America&#39;s Sephardic Elite</h2><p>The Sephardic Jews began a tradition of wealth, pride, and exclusiveness that continues to this day.

Paul Getty Museum)</h2><p>This catalogue of an exhibition at the J. Paul Getty Museum--to be held from October 10, 2006, to March 25, 2007--brings together a select group of paintings from Dresden's Galerie Neue Meister, which houses one of the most significant collections of nineteenth- and twentieth-century German art. This exhibition places at its core works from the two best-known painters from Dresden: Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840), a key voice of German Romanticism; and Gerhard Richter (b. 1932), the most celebrated German artist working today.<br> The catalogue, one of the few resources in English on the subject, will feature paintings by Carl Gustav Carus, J. C. Dahl, Otto Dix, and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff from the period between 1800 and World War I, the heyday of painting in Dresden. It will also introduce unfamiliar artists to a wider audience and juxtapose well-known painters in new ways. Included are essays on the history of the Neue Meister galleries and German painting from this period, entries on individual paintings, and an interview with Gerhard Richter.</p><p><br><strong>Ulrich Bischoff</strong> is director of the Galerie Neue Meister.<br> <br> <strong>Elisabeth Hipp</strong> is research assistant at the Gemï¿½ldegalerie Alte Meister.<br> <br> <strong>Jeanne Nugent</strong> is assistant professor of art history at Minnesota State University and an expert on the work of Gerhard Richter.<br></p><h2>Batman: War Games - Act 03 End Game</h2><p>Batman and his allies haven&#39;t been able to stop the chaos that threatens Gotham.

God could have come into the world as an adult, but He chose instead to be born as a baby to teach you key lessons about who He is and what He calls you to be - lessons that most Christians miss. No longer. In these eye-opening pages, Caryll Houselander reveals the powerful spiritual implications of one startling fact: in the manger, even as angels guarded and shepherds sought Him, the baby Jesus was already suffering for your sins. For your sake, our majestic God became a helpless infant at the mercy of His creatures. At the beginning of His life on earth, the God who raised the canopy of the heavens let Himself be raised off the cold ground by the humble wood of His cradle. With stunning and splendid humility, He was bound by gravity to that cradle just as firmly as He later would be bound by nails to the wood of His Cross - which again raised Him above the stony ground, once more at the mercy of those He created. In these facts, Caryll Houselander discovers a wealth of spiritual insights that give dramatic new meaning to Jesus&#39; admonition that you must &#34;become like a little child.&#34; With brilliant simplicity and holy warmth, she shows that in order to do so - and in order to know and love Jesus truly - you must transcend the cute baby Jesus of the sentimental hymns and come to see the Infant as He really is: our God of suffering and majesty, who even in the cradle shows you the straight path to holiness: the little way of the infant Jesus.</p><p>Caryll Houselander (1901-1954) was baptized as a child, but left the Faith as a teenager. She told the story of her lapse and Christian reawakening in her classic A Rocking-Horse Catholic. She is also author of the prayers in Sophia Institute Press&#39;s The Essential Rosary. Her passionate and profound writing will deepen your love for God.Some truths need to be told over and over again. Our Lord repeated certain truths about Himself and used certain images of Himself over and over again, like the rhyme in a song. Repetition not only instills an idea into our minds, but it has the same power that rhythm has to make the idea part of us and dear to us, even when it is hard in itself - and this gently and easily, just as a tune heard many times, sometimes quite unconsciously, becomes part of us and dear to us. But there is a difference between Christ&#39;s repetition and ours. He speaks creative words because He is God, and because, as man, He is a poet whom no other poet has ever come near to: His words echo and re-echo through the human heart. We, on the other hand, tend to become tedious in repetition, even when the thing that we are saying concerns God and is beautiful in itself. Yet everyone who writes about the Christ-life knows that unless certain things are repeated in every book he writes, much of it, or all of it, will be almost meaningless to many who read it. This is just such a book, and since the basic fact of the Christ-life, which is the key to everything in it, is the indwelling presence of Christ in us, I will repeat not something I have written about it before, but our Lord&#39;s own words telling us of it, on the night before He died: &#34;It is the truth-giving Spirit, for whom the world can find no room, because it cannot see Him, cannot recognize Him. . . . He will be continually at your side, nay, He will be in you.&#34; &#34;When that day comes, you will learn for yourselves that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.&#34; &#34;You have only to live on in me, and I will live on in you.&#34; &#34;I am the vine, you are its branches; if a man lives on in me, and I in him, then he will yield abundant fruit; separated from me, you have no power to do anything.&#34; &#34;I have bestowed my love upon you, just as my Father has bestowed His love upon me; live on, then, in my love. You will live on in my love, if you keep my commandments, just as it is by keeping my Father&#39;s commandments that I live on in His love.&#34;</p><h2>Kids' Crafts: Crochet: Fantastic Jewelry, Hats, Purses, Pillows &amp; More (Lark Kids' Crafts)</h2><p>A sparkling new entry in the popular Kids' Crafts series.

Misty and her sister were kept as slaves on a mountain ranch where they were subjected to almost complete isolation, sexual abuse and extreme physical violence. Their step-father kept a loaded rifle by the door at all times to make sure the young girls were too terrified to try to escape. They also knew that no rescue would ever come because only a couple of people even knew they existed and did not know them well enough to care.<br><br><b>Amish Sexual abuse:</b>&nbsp;When Misty reached her teens, her parents feared she and her sister would escape and took them to an Amish community where they were adopted and became baptized members. Misty was devastated to once again find herself in a world of fear, animal cruelty and sexual abuse. Going to the police was severely frowned upon. A few years later, Misty was sexually assaulted by the bishop. As Misty recalls, "Amish sexual abusers are only shunned by the church for six weeks, a punishment that never seems to work. After I was assaulted by the bishop I knew I had to get help and one freezing morning in early March I made a dash for a tiny police station in rural Minnesota. After reporting the bishop I left the Amish and found myself plummeted into the strange modern world with only a second-grade education and no ID or social security card.

MORALIST: I have gathered you good people together on this occasion because I know that you are among the most truthful people on earth, and so I propose that we hold a symposium on truthfulness. I wish to learn from each of you your reasons for being truthful. Adrian, what is your reason for being truthful? ADRIAN: My reason is quite simple. It says in the Bible that one should be truthful, and I take the Bible seriously. Since my greatest duty on earth is obedience to the will of God and God commands me to be truthful, my reason for being truthful is obvious. MORALIST: Very good! And you, Bernard, why are you truthful? BERNARD: I also take the Bible very seriously. The one thing in the Bible that impresses me most is the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. Since I wish others to be truthful with me, I am accordingly truthful with them. MORALIST: Excellent! And you, Carey, what are your reasons for being truthful? CAREY: My reasons have nothing to do with religion. I am truthful on purely ethical grounds. I desire to be virtuous, and since truthfulnessis one of the virtues and lying is one of the vices, then to be virtuous it is necessary for me to be truthful. EPISTEMOLOGIST ( <i>who is, strangely enough, in this group though he wasn't invited):</i> I find this reason peculiar! Carey evidently doesn't value truthfulness in its own right but only because it belongs to the more general category of virtue, and it is this more general category that he values. Indeed, his very way of putting it: "To be virtuous it is necessary for me to be truthful," his very use of the word <i>necessary</i> suggests that he is reluctant to be truthful but is nevertheless truthful only as a <i>means</i> to another end, that end being virtue itself. This is what I find so strange! Furthermore, I think-- MORALIST: Sorry to interrupt you, old man, but it was not my intention that we criticize the speakers as they go along. I prefer on this occasion to let the speakers simply state their views; we can reserve critical analysis for another time. And so, Daniel, why are you truthful? DANIEL: My reasons are also nonreligious--or at least nontheistic. I am a great admirer of the ethics of Immanuel Kant. I realize that his ethical attitudes were, at least psychologically, tied up with his religious ones, but many people who reject Kant's theistic views nevertheless accept his moral ones. I am one such person. I am truthful out of obedience to Kant's categorical imperative, which states that one should never perform any act unless one wills that act to be universal law. Since it is obvious that if everybody lied there would be utter chaos, I clearly cannot will it to be universal law that everybody lies. The categorical imperative hence implies that I, too, should not lie. MORALIST: Very good! And you, Edward, what are your reasons for being truthful? EDWARD: My reasons are purely humanistic and utilitarian. It is obvious that truthfulness is beneficial to society, and since my main interest in life is to benefit society, then accordingly I am truthful. MORALIST: Splendid! And you, Frank, why are you truthful? FRANK: In order to live up to my name. Since my name is Frank, then it behooves me to be frank with people. MORALIST: Stop being facetious! This is a serious symposium! What about you, George, why are you truthful? GEORGE: Because I am a selfish bastard! MORALIST: What! GEORGE: Exactly! The few times I have lied, I have ended up getting it in the neck! It's not other people I care about; I care about myself. I don't want any trouble! I have simply learned from hard and bitter experience that honesty is the best policy. MORALIST: What about you, Harry? HARRY: My ethical orientation is rather similar to that of George. But instead of using the rather harsh phrase <i>selfish bastard</i>, I would prefer to classify myself as a hedonist; I perform only those acts calculated to maximize my pleasure in life. I am not as fanatical as George; I place <i>some</i> value on other people's happiness but not as much as on my own. And I have much rational evidence that in the long run I will be happiest if I am always truthful. MORALIST: So you are a hedonist! In other words, you are truthful because it gives you pleasure to be truthful, and you avoid lying because you find lying painful. Is that it? HARRY: Not quite. I do not necessarily derive <i>immediate</i> pleasure from being truthful. Indeed, sometimes it is immediately painful. But I am a thoughtful and rational person; I am always willing to sacrifice my immediate pleasures for the sake of my ultimate good. I always plan ahead. Therefore, I am truthful since as I told you I have rational evidence that my being truthful is best for me in the long run. MORALIST: What is this evidence? HARRY: That is too long a story for us to go into now. I think we should instead hear the views of the other speakers. MORALIST: Very good. What about you, Irving? IRVING: I am also a hedonist. MORALIST: That so far makes three of you! George, Harry, and you. IRVING: Yes, but I am not like the others. MORALIST: How SO? IRVING: You mean how not! By temperament, I feel very different from George, and unlike Harry I am not the rational type of hedonist. Rather, I am a mystical hedonist. MORALIST: A mystical hedonist? That's a strange combination! I have never heard that one before. What on earth do you mean by a <i>mystical</i> hedonist? IRVING <i>(sadly):</i> I don't know! MORALIST: You don't know? How come you don't know? IRVING: Well, you see, since I am a mystical hedonist, I am also a hedonist. I feel that if I knew what I meant by a mystical hedonist, I would be less happy than I am not knowing what I mean. Therefore, on hedonistic grounds it is better that I do not know what I mean by a mystical hedonist. MORALIST: But if you don't even know what you <i>mean</i> by a mystical hedonist, how can you possibly know that you are one? IRVING: Good question! As you say, since I am unable to define a <i>mystical hedonist,</i> I couldn't possibly have rational grounds for knowing that I am one. Yet, in fact, I <i>do</i> know that I am one. This is precisely where my mysticism comes in MORALIST: Oh, my God! This is too complicated for <i>me!</i> IRVING: Me, too. MORALIST: At any rate, what is your reason for being truthful? The same as Harry's? IRVING: The reason is the same, but my <i>justification</i> of the reason is totally different. MORALIST: I don't understand. Can you explain this? IRVING: Why, yes. Like Harry, I believe that my telling the truth is best for me in the long run. But unlike Harry, I have no rationalevidence for this. Indeed, all the rational evidence I have is quite to the contrary. Therefore, the <i>rational</i> thing for me to do is to lie. But I have a strange intuition that I had best tell the truth. And being a mystic, I trust my intuition more than my reason. Hence, I tell the truth. MORALIST: Most extraordinary! And what about you, Jacob? JACOB: My truthfulness is a matter of contingency, not choice. MORALIST: I don't understand you! JACOB: I have simply never had the opportunity to lie. MORALIST: I understand you even less! JACOB: My attitude is as follows: Obviously, no one in his right mind would ever think of lying to his friends; it only makes sense to lie to one's enemies. If any enemy ever threatened to harm me, I would not for a moment hesitate to lie to divert his attack. But since I have no enemies and never have had any enemies, the opportunity for me to lie has never presented itself. MORALIST: How singular! And what about you, Kurt; what are your reasons for being truthful? KURT: I have only one reason. I am truthful simply because I <i>feel</i> like being truthful; I have no other reason than that. MORALIST: But that is no reason! KURT: Of course it is a reason! As I just told you, it's my <i>only</i> reason. MORALIST: But your reason is no good! KURT: Whoever said that I had a <i>good</i> reason? I said that it's my <i>reason</i>; I didn't say it was a <i>good</i> one. MORALIST: Oh, but just because you feel like being truthful, it does not follow that you <i>should</i> be truthful. Of course, I believe that you should be truthful but not merely because you <i>feel</i> like it. There are many things I feel like doing, but I don't do them because I know that I shouldn't do them. Not everything that one feels like doing is necessarily right! So why is your feeling like being truthful an adequate justification of your being truthful? EPISTEMOLOGIST: I thought we weren't supposed to argue with the speakers. MORALIST: I shall ignore that remark. I repeat my question: Just because you feel like being truthful, why does it follow that you should be truthful? KURT: <i>Should</i> be truthful? Who the hell ever said that <i>I should</i> be truthful? MORALIST: Don't tell me now that you believe that you <i>shouldn't</i> be truthful! KURT: Of course not! I don't give a damn what I should or shouldn't do! MORALIST: Oh, come now; surely you want to do what you believe you ought to do! KURT: What I <i>ought</i> to do! I couldn't care less! Look, man, I don't give one hoot for all your ethics, morality, religion, rights and wrongs, oughts and shoulds! As I told you, I feel like being truthful and that is my only reason. MORALIST: But I am trying to explain to you that that reason is inadequate! KURT: I don't give a damm whether it is adequate or not! It so happens I <i>feel</i> like being truthful! Do you mind? MORALIST: No, I don't mind. I don't mind at all. Only you needn't be so belligerent about it! Now what about you, Larry? Why are you truthful? LARRY: Why does a tree grow? MORALIST: Look now, we are not here to play mystical games with each other. I asked you a serious question. LARRY: And I gave you a serious answer. MORALIST: Oh, come now, what does a tree growing have to do with your being truthful? LARRY: More perhaps than you realize. MORALIST: I wish that you would stop giving these cryptic responses! What are you, one of these Zen Buddhists or something? LARRY: Yes. MORALIST: Oh, no wonder you talk in this strange manner! But you can't tell me why you are truthful? LARRY: Can you tell me why a tree grows? MORALIST: I still don't see what the growth of a tree has to do with your being truthful. LARRY: More perhaps than you realize. MORALIST: So we are back to that again! You Zen men are the most frustrating creatures to talk to! LARRY: In that case, why do you talk to us? But I'm glad you called me a <i>creature.</i> That at least shows that you have <i>some</i> insight into the true relationship between me and a tree. MORALIST: Oh, really now, in what significant way are you like a tree? LARRY: In what significant way am I different? MORALIST: Oh, surely now, you regard yourself as a <i>little</i> more significant than a tree, don't you? LARRY: Not at all. MORALIST: But do you not realize that a tree is at a lower stage of life than a man? LARRY: I find your use of the word <i>lower</i> ill advised. It is psychologically misleading and sets an emotional tone that is tantamount to begging the question. I would prefer to say that a tree is at an <i>earlier</i> stage of life. MORALIST: Let's not be pedantic and quibble about words! In this context, <i>lower</i> and <i>earlier</i> mean exactly the same thing LARRY: Oh no they don't! <i>Objectively</i> they may have the same meaning in this context but <i>subjectively</i> they certainly do not. One would say that a child is at an earlier stage of life than an adult but surely not at a lower stage This latter mode of speech gives the impression that an adult is superior to a child, which I don't believe many would wish to do. MORALIST: All right, have it your way; so you're <i>not</i> superior to a tree. But why are you truthful? And please don't answer my question again with the question, "Why does a tree grow?" LARRY: If you tell me why a tree grows, then perhaps I can tell you why I am truthful. MORALIST: I still don't see the connection between the two! Why must I first tell you why a tree grows? LARRY: Because I have great difficulty understanding your use of the word why. I was hoping that if you told me why a tree grows then I could gather enough data on your use of this word to help me answer your question more satisfactorily. MORALIST: Oh, so our difficulty is semantical! In that case, I'll use a different word. What is your <i>reason</i> for being truthful? LARRY: Does everything have to have a reason? MORALIST: Well of course! LARRY: Really now! Does a tree have a reason for growing? MORALIST: Of course not. At least, I don't think so. LARRY: Then why should I have a reason for being truthful? MORALIST: Because you are not a tree! LARRY: So because I am not a tree, it follows that I should have a reason for being truthful? MORALIST: Oh heavens, you are only confusing matters! Look, a tree is not a conscious being; it has no free will and makes no choices. So one would hardly expect a tree to have a reason for growing, but one would expect you to have a reason for what you do! LARRY: I grant you that if I were not conscious then I would not possibly have a reason for <i>anything</i> I do. But it does not therefore follow that because I <i>am</i> conscious I must have a reason for <i>everything</i> I do. In particular, I have absolutely no reason for being truthful. MORALIST: No reason? None at all? LARRY: None whatsoever! MORALIST: Fantastic! In other words, you are in the same category as Kurt. You feel like being truthful and that is the only reason you are. LARRY: No, no, not at all! You totally miss my point! As Kurt told you, his feeling like being truthful is, for him, his <i>reason</i> for being truthful. But I have no reason at all! MORALIST: You mean that you don't even feel like being truthful? LARRY: What a strange non sequitur! Of course I feel like being truthful; otherwise I wouldn't be truthful. MORALIST: So I was right! That <i>is</i> your reason for being truthful. LARRY: I am sorry, but you are still confused. I both feel like being truthful and am truthful but there is no evidence that either of these two phenomena is the reason of the other. MORALIST: Look, I just can't believe that you have <i>no reason at all</i> for being truthful! You <i>must</i> have a reason; you just don't know what it is! LARRY: At this point, I am not sure just which of several possible meanings of the word <i>reason</i> you have in mind. When you ask the reason for my being truthful, are you asking for my <i>motive</i> or <i>purpose</i> in being truthful, or are you seeking the <i>cause</i> of my truthfulness? Or are you perhaps asking whether I am truthful out of some <i>principle</i> like virtue or duty or obedience to God or the desire to serve humanity or to be personally well off? Which of these meanings do you have in mind? MORALIST: Take your choice! LARRY: I would rather you choose. MORALIST: Very well then. Which of these principles you mentioned is relevant to your case? LARRY: None of them. MORALIST: Then what is the principle you follow? LARRY: None whatsoever. I am not truthful on principle. MORALIST: All right then, let's go over to another of your suggested meanings, cause. What is the cause of your being truthful? LARRY: I have no idea. MORALIST: Aren't you helpful! LARRY: I am trying to be. MORALIST: You certainly don't seem to be trying! At any rate, let's go on to the next possibility. What is your motive or purpose in being truthful? LARRY: I am not aware of any motive, and I certainly ...</p><h2>Discovery Channel's Megalodon &amp; Prehistoric Sharks</h2><p><ul> <li>Enjoy this graphic novel's unique blast from the past as the ancestors of today's shark are brought to life again.

Charlotte Salomon, born in Germany in 1917, exiled to France in 1939, spent the next 2 intense, suspenseful years creating a lifetime's work--more than 700 watercolors overlaid by written texts and tunes that captured the dramatic events of her own life. This luminous work stands alone in the history of art and of autobiography. It is the most innovative record we have from the midst of the Holocaust, a visual path through those dark times. Salomon's work survives intact in Amsterdam, but until now no one has unfolded the real life behind the painted one. Mary Felstiner spent 10 years of searching for &amp; interviewing Salomon's relatives &amp; classmates, her mentor's students, her acquaintances in exile, &amp; survivors of the concentration camps. Felstiner shapes an immensely moving account of a woman haunted by personal trauma &amp; trapped in grim historical conditions. TO PAINT HER LIFE resounds with the artist's own words &amp; images. We see her losing her mother to suicide. Being admitted to the prestigious Berlin Art Academy and then expelled. Witnessing the rising tide of Nazism. Falling in love &amp; suffering loss. Leaving her home for exile on the Riviera. Choosing whether to take her own life--or to put it into art. Painting secrets her family kept from her &amp; secrets she kept from them. Making choices that speak to us all--to love someone, to leave a home, to face memories, to recount it all. TO PAINT HER LIFE also traces a shadow story behind Charlotte Salomon's--that of Alois Brunner, Eichmann's right-hand man, the notorious SS officer responsible for deporting to death camps more than 100,000 Jews. With Salomon &amp; Brunner representing creation and destruction in sharp contrast, Felstiner brings together previously unknown facts of their 2 lives &amp; opens provocative ne perspectives on gender and genocide.</p><p>A remarkable biography of a Jewish artist whose vivid autobiographical portraits provide a stunning look at her life as a woman, an artist, and a Jew during the Holocaust.Mary Lowenthal Felstiner is Professor of History at San Francisco State University.</p><h2>Valentin Carron: Learning from Martigny</h2><p>Neither authentic nor kitsch, readymade nor traditional craft, the works of Swiss artist Valentin Carron (born 1975) play with material ambiguity--fake wood, fake concrete, fake bronze--to unpack the iconography of power and authority. <i>Learning from Martigny</i> offers photographic source material intertwined with images of his sculptures and paintings.</p><p></p><h2>The Borribles</h2><p>In the unspecified future in London, a war erupts between the Borribles, a gang of creatures who formerly were children, and their arch enemies, the Rumbles.</p><p>Michael de Larrabeiti was brought up in Battersea. He is the author of two more books about the Borribles--<i>The Borribles </i>and <i>The Borribles Go For Broke</i>--as well as many other books. He has three grown-up daughters and lives with his wife in Oxfordshire. <br><br>BORRIBLES: ACROSS THE DARK METROPOLIS<br>1Sergeant Hanks of the Metropolitan Police and second in command of the Special Borrible Group sat on a chair outside the office of the District Assistant Commissioner and picked his nose in a state of unalloyed rapture. He had excavated very successfully for ten minutes in the left nostril and he was now delving in the right one. As the curved nail of his index finger dug into something soft and spongy his eyes closed with the joy of an exquisite physical pleasure, and when, at last, the moist and luxuriant bogey was pulled reluctantly away from its tenacious root and coaxed out into the light, Hanks just half opened a single eye and examined his trophy with a close and professional interest.'Hmm,' he said, 'first class that one, looks like a well-fed whelk.' And he stuck it under his chair and crossed his fat ankles in utter contentment. This was the life.Inside the office, Sergeant Hanks's superior, Inspector Sussworth, was not enjoying himself. Quite the contrary. He was standing to attention before a large leather-topped desk, his lips tightly clenched and his postage stamp of a moustache humming with indignation. Sussworth was in serious trouble and the District Assistant Commissioner was making sure that he knew it.'It's not good enough,' said the DAC, 'just not good enough. Two months ago I was assured that you had these Borribles all cooped up in Wandsworth. No way out, eh? That's what you said. And the horse, eh? Where are they now?'Inspector Sussworth opened his mouth to answer but shut it again immediately as the DAC held up his hand for silence.'Escaped, that's what, escaped.' The DAC's voice was pointed and half-transparent, like shards of bone china. He was elegantly turned out in a well-cut suit of dark grey and a shirt that was as crisp as newly fallen snow. His tie indicated, discreetly, that he had once been connected with an exclusive regiment, and his shoes shone so brilliantly that it was impossible to tell what colour they were.He examined one of those shoes for a second, on the end of a stiffly straight leg, and, satisfied with the sheen, he got to his feet, rising easily from his swivel chair. 'You see, Sussworth,' he continued, 'I gave you the command of the finest body of men to be found in any police force in the world, in the world mark you, and all you have managed to achieve is a spectacular failure.' The DAC snorted and began to pace the olive-green carpet that covered the wide expanses of his office floor.Sussworth gazed out of the window and down on to the jumbled skyline of London. It was wet out there, and cold. It had stopped raining but only so that it could start again presently. Only midway through the afternoon and the office lights were already gleaming across the dark from a thousand windows in a hundred skyscrapers.Sussworth sighed. London was his patch, all of it. He sighed again. It was the Borribles' patch too; the whole town was lousy with them. At that very moment Borribles were out on the streets stealing stuff like nobody's business; and if they weren't stealing they were idling and lounging about in empty houses; activities that Sussworth had sworn to stop.The DAC returned from his stroll and stood once again behind the desk, facing the inspector. He was tall and languid, the DAC, and his face was well bred and haughty and pink, like a judge's in a wig. He sighed too, deeply, as if exhausted by being alive; the road of his life had been strewn with fools.'All you have done, Sussworth,' he said, 'is to smash up some Transit vans on Eel Brook Common, get some twenty of your men injured and invalided out of the force, and then allowed these Borrible ringleaders to escape.' He raised his hand as Sussworth took a breath. '"Safe and sound, sir," you said. "Safe and sound in Wandsworth. They can't get away." Can't get away, eh? Not only did they get away but they got away with a horse. Dash it all man, a horse! It escapedfrom your own police station. Why, you were the laughin' stock of everyone'.Sussworth fidgeted on his feet but made no attempt to answer.'I admit,' went on the DAC, setting off on another stroll, 'that you've captured a few Borribles and clipped their ears, but you couldn't call them important, they aren't the chaps we want. Concentrate on the ringleaders.'Sussworth twitched his neck. He could not bear to stand still for so long. He needed to be on the go; stamping, turning, marching.'Don't you realize, Sussworth, that the more you let these Borribles get away with things the more they undermine society? We can't allow it. It is our responsibility to see that society stays where it is. We can't have Borribles doin' what they like, livin' as they like, goin' where they like. You must find this gang of Borribles and eliminate them. Above all you must find their horse, which seems to act as some kind of mascot, and you will turn it into catsmeat. If you fail, Sussworth, then I'm afraid I shall be obliged to hand your job over to Chief Superintendent Birdlime of C Division. He's an up and comin' chap, you know, and as keen as mustard.'Sussworth was allowed to speak at last: 'I've tried everything sir, but London's such a huge place. It is not plain sailing to apprehend these malcontents.'The DAC gave Sussworth a pitying smile from the fireplace, where he had propped himself at an angle against the wall. 'My dear Sussworth,' he said, 'it is your duty to apprehend them, and once apprehended to make sure they have no chance to get away again. If the old methods are not successful you must try new methods; you must be crafty, sly and even evil if necessary. Do you think that Caesar and Alexander got to the top by playing the white man? Think, Sussworth, think. You must infiltrate Borrible culture; you need a fifth column, spies, traitors. Do anythin' to achieve your end ... but don't tell me about it. Inform me of your success, but not how you do it.'Sussworth's moustache began to twitch in anger but he restrained himself. He nodded vigorously. 'Yes sir, infiltrate, bribe, corrupt. Yes sir.'The DAC ambled back to his seat and lowered his body into it. He placed his elbows on the desk and laced the fingers of his right handwith those of his left. 'Don't you realize, Sussworth, that life is a game of snakes and ladders? If we are successful, you and I, there is promotion in this. We would both be up the ladder. I could be Commissioner this time next year and you ... Well, for a man of your energy and intelligence, the sky's the limit, the sky.'The DAC smiled wisely and rotated his chair at a leisurely speed so that he could look out through the plate glass of his window. The storm clouds, heavy with rain, had lowered themselves down to a dim horizon, and the endless confusion of London roofs and buildings was fading into one dull tone of dark blue.The DAC stretched his arms. 'Winter's comin',' he said as if the statement were philosophy, 'and that can only help. Not so many people on the streets; the Borribles will be easier to spot. It's up to you, Sussworth, complete annihilation of this criminal band of Borribles, nothing else will satisfy me. Don't let me hear anythin' but good news, do you follow? Eh? Or it will be bad news for you. Birdlime is waitin', Birdlime is waitin'.''Yes sir,' said Sussworth. 'Of course, sir.' He stood hesitant, not knowing if he had been dismissed or not. He waited for the DAC to swivel round from the window, but the DAC remained gazing into the darkening panorama spread out below him, watching the lights shine ever brighter.Sussworth decided to leave. His moustache twitched and twirled, and he saluted and turned in one nervous movement and marched quickly over the carpet towards the polished oak door of the office. He opened it and passed through, closing it reverentially behind him, the muscles of his face rigid with hate.&nbsp;<br>Inspector Sussworth seized his hands behind his back and strutted between the door and the window of his office like Admiral Nelson on his quarterdeck. Sergeant Hanks had hooked his large and wobbly buttocks on the desk, folded his arms over his egg-stained tunic and was cocking his fleshy ears to scoop up every word his superior was about to utter. Both men were in the SBG headquarters, Micklethwaite. Road, Fulham.'That was a high-powered conference at Scotland Yard,' Sussworth said, 'very high-powered.'Hanks loosened his fat lips and smiled blankly. At the same time hepushed his hand into a coat pocket and drew out a bar of chocolate. 'I'm glad to hear it, sir,' he said. 'Care for some fruit and nut?'Sussworth waved his hand impatiently and spun on his heel through a hundred and eighty degrees, about ninety degrees more than he had intended, and was somewhat surprised to find himself facing the window overlooking the street. 'There is more to life than fruit and nut,' he said, his voice sombre. 'We have problems, Hanks, vast problems.'Hanks looked at the inspector's back and shoved half the chocolate into his mouth, salivating so freely that the moisture dribbled down his chin. It was a brown colour flecked with chewed raisins.'The DAC and I,' continued the inspector, 'have decided that the situation, <i>re</i> the Borribles, is critical and chronic. A new initiative must be implemented. We are going to concentrate our efforts on the main criminal gang, the gang from Eel Brook Common. Those ragamuffins must be apprehended and their ears clipped without delay. Their hideouts must be demolished. They've got to be made to behave like everyone else, earn money like everyone else and grow up like everyone else. Society is our responsibility, Hanks.''It is indeed, sir,' agreed Hanks, masticating slowly, lips smacking.'There is a slackness in the ranks, Hanks. Both the DAC and I had a long discussion about this. The Borribles are undermining the pillars of society and when that happens those pillars topple. Freedom leads to anarchy. They must conform to law and order.''They must conform indeed,' said Hanks. He lifted his weight from the desk and waded to a food cabinet which stood just outside the door of the office. He opened this cupboard and, taking out a roll, he cut it in half, buttered it and then spread it with thick honey.'I likes this stuff,' he announced, and squeezed the roll between his teeth so that the honey oozed over his chin and on to his tunic.Sussworth ignored the remark and performed a reverse turn quickstep across the room and around the desk. He sat down and then got up again immediately as if he had sat in something wet and nasty. His expression hardened and his moustache twitched from side to side, matching the movements of his feet.'The men will have to be reprimanded,' he said, 'and then retrained. We have to get those Borribles and above all that horse. This is a crisis. We must think of something new: bribery, corruption.''That's not new, sir.''There's promotion in the offing, Hanks. You will become an inspector; I shall rise to DAC and the DAC will get a knighthood. Imagine the glory, Hanks. Knighthoods. Sir Sergeant Hanks. Lord Sussworth of Fulham. The mind boggles.''Boggles,' said Hanks.Sussworth raised a hand to his forehead and fell into his chair. 'This is our last chance. If we fail we will be demoted to the ranks and Birdlime will be in. We have to think of some means of penetrating the Borrible infrastructure.''Super-narks!''Exactly.''What we need is someone on the inside,' said Hanks. 'That's what we need.'Sussworth got out of his chair again, stamped both feet at once and strode to the window. His hands, still behind his back, made a determined attempt to strangle one another. 'Precisely,' he said, and emotion steamed out of his ears like there were two kettles boiling in his head.Hanks stood in the middle of the room, lifted a finger to his nose and screwed it into a nostril just as far as it would go, about the second knuckle. 'What we want,' he said, 'is a regiment of bloody dwarfs.'Silence slid down over the room like a tipper-truck load of wet cement. Sussworth suddenly crouched and turned from the window very slowly, inch by inch, pointing a rigid finger at his subordinate who continued to stand, all innocent, grappling with a bogey. Sussworth laughed the laugh of contentment.'Ha! Hanks, ha! I have just had the most brilliant idea.' Sussworth advanced towards his sergeant, still crouching and still pointing. 'Did you know I was top of my year at Hendon Police College? My brain is a computer that never stops computing, taking in information and storing it until the day when, compressed by the white heat of necessity ... You Reeker! Out comes the desired answer. In other words, what we need is a regiment of dwarfs.'A look of puzzlement wandered over Hanks's face and he removed the finger from his nose without even looking at it. 'I just said that,' he said. He took a teapot from the cupboard and ladled some tea into it. 'I could have sworn I said that.'Sussworth straightened his back and dropped his pointing arm. He jigged around to the rear of the desk and sat down. 'Don't be foolish, Hanks,' he said. 'I do not want to see you change the habits of a lifetime, habits that have stood you in good stead. Your job is not inception but implementation.''Oh,' said Hanks, and he flicked on the switch that controlled the electric kettle.'That's why I am in my position and you are in yours, Sergeant,' said Sussworth as prim as a parson. 'Now listen to me. We shall place advertisements, discreetly, in the newspapers, especially the trade papers--<i>The Stage, The Circus and Sideshow, Fun-Fair Weekly</i>--all of them, offering employment to young adult midgets and dwarfs. Got that, Hanks? We only want the young-looking ones.'Hanks unplugged the boiling kettle and poured its contents into the teapot.'We want midgets from all walks of life,' said Sussworth. 'We'll train them and get them ready; we'll tell them all about Borrible customs, everything. They'll steal and live in broken houses like Borribles and they'll know all the proverbs, just like Borribles. They will infiltrate, insinuate and penetrate.'Hanks sucked at his tea and made a noise like water going down a drain in the middle of a storm. 'Dwarfs don't have pointed ears,' he observed. 'Borribles do.' The sergeant smiled like a quicksand smiling at the sound of approaching footsteps; there was no answer to that.Sussworth banged the desk and stamped the floor. 'You can't beat me,' he said. 'Honours at Hendon, that's what I got. We'll have special plastic ears fabricated, pointed, and we'll clip them on.'Hanks's vast stomach rolled under his stained tunic like water in a balloon. 'I don't think that will work, sir. If a Borrible gets suspicious of one of your spies and pulls at his ears, why, then the lugholes would come off and bye-bye dwarfs. The Borribles would have their guts for garters.' He handed the inspector a mugful of tea, hot, black and strong.Sussworth sipped. 'Difficulties,' he said, 'only exist to be overcome by minds like mine. If clips won't achieve our purpose then we shall affix the ears with superglue; nothing gets that off, I can assure you, however a Borrible might pull at it.''Superglue,' said Hanks. 'But them dwarfs'd never get the ears unstuck again. I can't see them standing for that ...

A casual conversation-or any social interaction that the rest of us take for granted-will, for Morgan, always be a cryptogram that must be painstakingly decoded. He lives in a world of his own: an autistic world.</p><p>In <i>Not Even Wrong</i>, Paul Collins melds a memoir of his son's autism with a journey into this realm of permanent outsiders. Examining forgotten geniuses and obscure medical archives, Collins's travels take him from an English churchyard to the Seattle labs of Microsoft, and from a Wisconsin prison cell block to the streets of Vienna. It is a story that reaches from a lonely clearing in the Black Forest into the London palace of King George I, from Defoe and Swift to the discovery of evolution; from the modern dawn of the computer revolution to, in the end, the author's own household. </p><p><i>Not Even Wrong</i> is a haunting journey into the borderlands of neurology - a meditation on what "normal" is, and how human genius comes to us in strange and wondrous forms.</p></p><p>Paul Collins and his wife Jennifer thought their son was perfect. At age one, Morgan learned the alphabet; by two, he was reading, counting, even doing multiplication tables--yet he couldn't respond to his own name and scarcely noticed others in the room. He was, as it turned out, autistic--gifted, intelligent, preternaturally focused, but a stranger in the strange land of human emotions. Fortunately, Paul Collins is eminently suited to act as his guide. The author of <i>Banvard's Folly</i> and the bibliophile's delight <i>Sixpence House</i>, Collins is a very particular kind of historian: an archaelogist of the arcane and a lover of eccentric people and facts. <i>Not Even Wrong</i> turns that love to the best possible use. Part memoir, part history, it traces the lives of suspected autists both famous and obscure, from Peter the Wild Boy, a semi-feral child who became a sensation at the court of George I, to Henry Darger, the recluse and outsider artist. Collins dabbles in neurology and science history, but what emerges is nothing less than a portrait of how Morgan's mind works--as well as a respectful and fascinating account of those with autism and their contributions to our world. <i>--Mary Park</i><p><b>Paul Collins</b> is the author of <i>Sixpence House</i> and <i>Banvard's Folly</i>. He edits the <i>Collins Library</i> for McSweeney's Books, and his work has appeared in <i>New Scientist, Business 2.0</i>, and <i>Tin House.</i></p></p><h2>The Big Time (Gregg Press science fiction series)</h2><p>Have you ever worried about your memory, because it doesn't seem to recall exactly the same past from one day to the next? Have you ever thought that the whole universe might be a crazy, mixed-up dream? If you have, then you've had hints of the Change War.<br><br>It's been going on for a billion years and it will last another billion or so. Up and down the timeline, the two sides--"Spiders" and "Snakes"--battle endlessly to change the future and the past. Our lives, our memories, are their battleground. And in the midst of the war is the Place, outside space and time, where Greta Forzane and the other Entertainers provide solace and r-&amp;-r for tired time warriors.<br></p><p>Fritz Leiber (1910-1992) is best known as a fantasy writer, but his achievements and influence are also considerable in the horror and science fiction fields. One of his major SF works is the Change War series, about rival time-traveling armies locked in a bitter, age-old war for control of existence; the battles frequently alter the course of human history. The most important work of Leiber's Change War series is the Hugo Award-winning novel <i>The Big Time</i>, in which doctors, entertainers, and wounded soldiers find themselves treacherously trapped with an activated atomic bomb inside the Place, a room existing outside of space-time. It's not one of Leiber's strongest novels: the cutesy-girlish narrative voice is unconvincing, while the demands of describing time travel and time paradoxes inevitably strain the prose. But <i>The Big Time</i> is a tense, claustrophobic SF mystery, and possibly the ultimate locked-room whodunit.<p> In addition to the Hugo, Nebula, Derleth, Lovecraft, and World Fantasy Awards, Fritz Leiber received the Grand Master of Fantasy (Gandalf) Award, the Life Achievement Lovecraft Award, and the Grand Master Nebula Award. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Fritz Leiber, who died in 1992, was one of the most important SF and fantasy writers of the century. <i>The Big Time</i> is his most famous SF novel. "[His] awards for fantasy included the 1975 Grand Master of Fantasy Award, the 1976 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, the 1981 Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America, 6 Hugos, 4 Nebulas, and about 20 other awards.<br></p><h2>BMW: Driven to Succeed (Haynes Classic MakesSeries)</h2><p>BMW has become one of the world&#39;s most famous and desirable makes of car.

Reviewing the graphics, scripts and marketing of each era, he discovers the links between cartoons and live action movies, newspapers, popular illustration, and the entertainment architecture coming out of Disneyland. Klein shows that the cartoon was a perverse juggling act, invaded constantly by economic and political pressures, by marketing for sound, by licensing characters to stave off bankruptcies, by Prohibition, the Great Depression, World War II and the first wave of television.</p><p><b>Norman M. Klein</b> is a critic and historian of mass culture, editor of <i>Fragile Moments: A History of Media-Induced Experience, </i>and author of <i>Seven Minutes: The Life and Death of the American Animated Cartoon</i> from Verso. He teaches at the California Institute of the Arts in Los Angeles.An aggressively didactic history of the animated cartoon from the days before Mickey Mouse to the rise (or fall, depending on your feelings about the Flintstones) of Hanna-Barbera's 137 TV programs. Unlike Eric Smoodin's Animating Culture (p. 516), Klein's history insists on maintaining a sharp focus: It's interested almost exclusively in how and why the shape of the seven-minute cartoon short changed from Felix the Cat to Disney and Warners to the UPA cartoons (Gerald McBoing-Boing, Mr. Magoo) of the 50's. What modes of space and entertainment have different cartoons drawn their inspiration from? The earliest cartoons, argues Klein (California Institute of the Arts), were staged in the depthless space of vaudeville gags, their jokes typically depending on spatial transformations between foreground characters and background objects (Felix using his tail as a crank to start a prop car). What Disney brought to the cartoon short was a fascination with the same deep space that marked live-action movies, with a corresponding emphasis on realistic melodrama, full animation, and the artful illusions of the multiplane camera. Even as Disney was turning increasingly to features and merchandising tie-ins (which alone kept the studio solvent in the 30's and 40's), Tex Avery and Chuck Jones at Warners were leading a more formulaic return to the anarchic chases of the earliest animation. Meanwhile, UPA pioneered the stripped-down style of ``consumer cubism,'' inspired not by painting but by advertisements, architecture, and consumer spaces like shopping malls and amusement parks. Klein's often schoolmarmish tone gets in the way of his ambitious secondary goal--to provide a history of the American audience's perception. As a brief history of the evolution of Hollywood cartoons, though, this could hardly be improved. (B&amp;w illustrations) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

First, firearms replaced bows as the weapons of choice on Western battlefields; then the new skills of literacy, numeracy, and book knowledge became essential to lead men into war. Suddenly, the old order, and the old commanders, were out, and new-style armies were taking the world by storm. Rich with anecdotal detail, a compelling and comprehensive narrative by an expert military historian transports you to the midst of the action as it examines the strategies, campaigns, prominent figures, and key conflicts of the age. From artillery and fortifications to military leadership, from cavalry tactics to the new infantry, from the Crusades to the guerrilla wars in late 16th-century France, penetrating cultural, tactical, and technical analyses plus numerous illustrations, maps, and charts paint a full portrait of war during the Renaissance.<br></p><p>Connecticut<br></p><h2>The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: Volume 1: A-F</h2><p>Folk and fairy tales exist in all cultures and are at the heart of civilization.

By demonstrating that these two seemingly separate and irreconcilable religions can actually unite in one person&#x2019;s spiritual practice at the center of his life &#x2014; as they did in his &#x2014; he offers an alternative to religious intolerance and strife, as well as hope for personal liberation.</p><p>Russill Paul is a world-renowned musician as well as a teacher of Eastern spirituality. He trained simultaneously as a monk and Yogi under the direction of the renowned sage and mystic Bede Griffiths in South India for close to five years and has taught in graduate and postgraduate spirituality programs for the past seventeen years. Born and raised in India, Russill lives in Austin, Texas, and runs a Yogic Mystery School. He performs and conducts workshops, retreats, and pilgrimages throughout the world.This is a profound book with a unifying message to read, practice, and embody.&#x201d;<br> Michael Bernard Beckwith, author of <i>Spiritual Liberation</i><br><br> Russill Paul, in his book <i>Jesus in the Lotus</i>, takes us on a journey not beyond Christianity but through Christianity to new levels of consciousness that most religious systems never reach. Guided by his mentor, Bede Griffiths, he explores the edges of faith by going to the center. It is a refreshing book, especially for those who are spiritually disenfranchised by the current shape of organized religion.&#x201d;<br> John Shelby Spong, author of <i>Jesus for the Non-Religious</i><br><br> Russill Paul has seen the path between East and West through the eyes, heart, and practice of devotion.

While respecting difference and honoring uniqueness, Russill Paul leads the reader to points of contact and harmony between Christianity, Yoga, and Hindu philosophy. Today there is a universal hunger for a new vision that unites and connects us all, without which there may not be a future for humanity.

Everett </b>is the Chair of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at Illinois State University.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Prologue<br><br>&#x201c;Look! There he is, Xigagaï¿½, the spirit.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I can see him. He is threatening us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Everybody, come see Xigagaï¿½. Quickly! He is on the beach!&#x201d;<br><br>I roused from my deep sleep, not sure if I was dreaming or hearing this conversation. It was 6:30 on a Saturday morning in August, the dry season of 1980. The sun was shining, but not yet too hot. A breeze was blowing up from the Maici River in front of my modest hut in a clearing on the bank. I opened my eyes and saw the palm thatch above me, its original yellow graying from years of dust and soot. My dwelling was flanked by two smaller Pirahï¿½ huts of similar construction, where lived Xahoï¿½bisi, Kï¿½hoibiï¿½ihï¿½ai, and their families.<br><br>Mornings among the Pirahï¿½s, so many mornings, I picked up the faint smell of smoke drifting from their cook fires, and the warmth of the Brazilian sun on my face, its rays softened by my mosquito net. Children were usually laughing, chasing one another, or noisily crying to nurse, the sounds reverberating through the village. Dogs were barking. Often when I first opened my eyes, groggily coming out of a dream, a Pirahï¿½ child or sometimes even an adult would be staring at me from between the paxiuba palm slats that served as siding for my large hut. This morning was different.<br><br>I was now completely conscious, awakened by the noise and shouts of Pirahï¿½s. I sat up and looked around. A crowd was gathering about twenty feet from my bed on the high bank of the Maici, and all were energetically gesticulating and yelling. Everyone was focused on the beach just across the river from my house. I got out of bed to get a better look&#x2014;and because there was no way to sleep through the noise.<br><br>I picked my gym shorts off the floor and checked to make sure that there were no tarantulas, scorpions, centipedes, or other undesirables in them. Pulling them on, I slipped into my flip- flops and headed out the door. The Pirahï¿½s were loosely bunched on the riverbank just to the right of my house. Their excitement was growing. I could see mothers running down the path, their infants trying to hold breasts in their mouths.<br><br>The women wore the same sleeveless, collarless, midlength dresses they worked and slept in, stained a dark brown from dirt and smoke. The men wore gym shorts or loincloths. None of the men were carrying their bows and arrows. That was a relief. Prepubescent children were naked, their skin leathery from exposure to the elements. The babies&#x2019; bottoms were calloused from scooting across the ground, a mode of locomotion that for some reason they prefer to crawling. Everyone was streaked from ashes and dust accumulated by sleeping and sitting on the ground near the fire.<br><br>It was still around seventy- two degrees, though humid, far below the hundred- degree- plus heat of midday. I was rubbing the sleep from my eyes. I turned to Kï¿½hoi, my principal language teacher, and asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; He was standing to my right, his strong, brown, lean body<br>tensed from what he was looking at.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you see him over there?&#x201d; he asked impatiently. &#x201c;Xigagaï¿½, one of the beings that lives above the clouds, is standing on the beach yelling at us, telling us he will kill us if we go to the jungle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right there!&#x201d; Kï¿½hoi snapped, looking intently toward the middle of the apparently empty beach.<br><br>&#x201c;In the jungle behind the beach?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No! There on the beach. Look!&#x201d; he replied with exasperation.<br><br>In the jungle with the Pirahï¿½s I regularly failed to see wildlife they saw. My inexperienced eyes just weren&#x2019;t able to see as theirs did.<br><br>But this was different. Even I could tell that there was nothing on that white, sandy beach no more than one hundred yards away. And yet as certain as I was about this, the Pirahï¿½s were equally certain that there was something there. Maybe there had been something there that I just missed seeing, but they insisted that what they were seeing, Xigagaï¿½, was still there.<br><br>Everyone continued to look toward the beach. I heard Kristene, my six- year- old daughter, at my side.<br><br>&#x201c;What are they looking at, Daddy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I can&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201d;<br><br>Kris stood on her toes and peered across the river. Then at me. Then at the Pirahï¿½s. She was as puzzled as I was.<br><br>Kristene and I left the Pirahï¿½s and walked back into our house. What had I just witnessed? Over the more than two decades since that summer morning, I have tried to come to grips with the significance of how two cultures, my European- based culture and the Pirahï¿½s&#x2019; culture, could see reality so differently. I could never have proved to the Pirahï¿½s that the beach was empty. Nor could they have convinced me that there was anything, much less a spirit, on it.<br><br>As a scientist, objectivity is one of my most deeply held values. If we could just try harder, I once thought, surely we could each see the world as others see it and learn to respect one another&#x2019;s views more readily. But as I learned from the Pirahï¿½s, our expectations, our culture, and<br>our experiences can render even perceptions of the environment nearly<br>incommensurable cross- culturally.<br><br>The Pirahï¿½s say different things when they leave my hut at night on their way to bed. Sometimes they just say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going.&#x201d; But frequently they use an expression that, though surprising at first, has come to be one of my favorite ways of saying good night: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t sleep, there are snakes.&#x201d; The Pirahï¿½s say this for two reasons. First, they believe that by sleeping less they can &#x201c;harden themselves,&#x201d; a value they all share. Second, they know that danger is all around them in the jungle and that sleeping soundly can leave one defenseless from attack by any of the numerous predators around the village. The Pirahï¿½s laugh and talk a good part of the night. They don&#x2019;t sleep much at one time. Rarely have I heard the village completely quiet at night or noticed someone sleeping for several hours straight. I have learned so much from the Pirahï¿½s over the years. But this is perhaps my favorite lesson. Sure, life is hard and there is plenty of danger. And it might make us lose some sleep from time to time. But enjoy it. <br><br>Life goes on.<br><br>I went to the Pirahï¿½s when I was twenty- six years old. Now I am old enough to receive senior discounts. I gave them my youth. I have contracted<br>malaria many times. I remember several occasions on which the Pirahï¿½s or others threatened my life. I have carried more heavy boxes, bags, and barrels on my back through the jungle than I care to remember. But my grandchildren all know the Pirahï¿½s. My children are who they are in part because of the Pirahï¿½s. And I can look at some of those old men (old like me) who once threatened to kill me and recognize some of the dearest friends I have ever had&#x2014;men who would now risk their lives for me.<br><br>This book is about the lessons I have learned over three decades of studying and living with the Pirahï¿½s, a time in which I have tried my best to comprehend how they see, understand, and talk about the world and to transmit these lessons to my scientific colleagues. This journey has taken me to many places of astounding beauty and into many situations I would rather not have entered. But I am so glad that I made the journey&#x2014;it has given me precious and valuable insights into the nature of life, language, and thought that could not have been learned any other way.<br><br>The Pirahï¿½s have shown me that there is dignity and deep satisfaction in facing life and death without the comfort of heaven or the fear of hell and in sailing toward the great abyss with a smile. I have learned these things from the Pirahï¿½s, and I will be grateful to them as long as I live.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Fleet: The Flying Years</h2><p>Autographed by author.

More than 400,000 Americans and 600,000 Europeans visit Argentina every year to enjoy the mighty malbec, taste unparalleled food, trek the wide-open country, and tango all night long in Buenos Aires. <em>Vino Argentino</em> provides insider access to beautiful Argentina.</p><p>Laura Catena belongs to the fourth generation of an Argentine-Italian winemaking family and serves as president of Botega Catena Zapata. She splits her time between San Francisco and Mendoza.<br><br>Sara Remington is a San Francisco-based photographer.Argentina's reputation as a producer of wonderful wine is on the rise; it's now the world's sixth-largest, and wine-based tourism is rapidly growing. Author and vintner Catena (Mendoza: Our Terroir), the fourth generation of her family to produce wine, keeps her tight focus on the country's Mendoza region and the many wineries that take advantage of its "enviable terrior...of low-fertility soils, cool mountain nights, sunny days, and low humidity." These qualities appeal to tourists as well, and Catena's effort, including friendly conversations with wine-makers, intimate looks at restaurants and wines, a chapter of recipes, and well-researched historical anecdotes, provides ample temptation to visit, aided by Sara Remington's luminous photos of the Mendoza region and its people. Catena could have included a few more trappings to make her book more vacation-friendly (like a map of the country or a discussion of cost) but, as the title promises, her focus is wine, not museums, parks, or malls, and it makes a nice addition for the wine lover.

More than 200 delectable recipes-gathered from Green&#39;s travels and from famous chefs and restaurants-are accompanied by essential information on bean varieties, cooking methods, and equipment.</p><p><b>Aliza Green</b> is the author of five successful cookbooks, beginning with her authorial partnership with French chef Georges Perrier on <i>Le Bec-Fin Recipes</i>. She also co-authored <i>ï¿½Ceviche!: Seafood, Salads, and Cocktails with a Latino Twist</i> with chef Guillermo Piernot, which won a James Beard Award for Best Single Subject Cookbook.&#x201d; <i>Beans: More than 200 Delicious, Wholesome Recipes from Around the World</i>, appeared as one of The New York Times' top cookbooks of the year. She has also authored <i>Field Guide to Meat</i> and <i>Field Guide to Produce</i>. Green's food columns and articles appear in a variety of local and national newspapers and magazines, including in <i>Fine Cooking</i>, <i>Prevention</i>, <i>Philadelphia Magazine</i>, the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, <i>Philadelphia Daily News</i>, and <i>The National Culinary Review</i>. She has conducted numerous cooking classes, had many television appearances, including NBC's <i>Today Show</i>, and radio interviews, and is a highly reputed television and print food stylist.In the growing field of bean and grain cookbooks, Green does an above-average job with these well-written multiethnic recipes ranging from Italian Chickpea Fries to Chinese Steamed Clams with Fermented Black Bean Sauce. Her hefty introduction is packed with history, helpful information and the requisite section on minimizing gas when eating a legume-loaded diet. A legume family tree divides beans and their ilk into four major branches, and the glossary covers even rarer varieties like appaloosa beans. A sub-section on products derived from soy (i.e., soy sauce and miso) is also a winning inclusion. Best of all, Green has a knack for enlivening tired ideas. For example, her Vegetarian Chili with Red Beans and White Hominy contains butternut squash and cumin seeds. Some of the main dishes consist of several different components: Grilled Lamb Patties with Turkish White Bean Salad and Marinated Carrots, and Israeli Couscous with Eggplant Rolls and Chickpeas. And Green pays homage to recent culinary trendsAsuch as Asian Wrap Sandwiches with Shiitakes, Bean Sprouts and Hoisin Sauce (rolled in tortillas)Awithout neglecting old legume favorites like Spicy Homemade Beer Nuts. Not all recipes are vegetarian, but those that are she thoughtfully marks as such. This is a worthwhile addition to the bean cookery shelf.

Bennett, Photographer: His American Landscape</h2><p><p>"My energies for near a lifetime have been used almost entirely to win such prominence as I could in outdoor photography."&#x2014;H. H. Bennett</p><p>Henry Hamilton Bennett (1843&#x2013;1908) became a celebrated photographer in the half-century following the American Civil War. Bennett is admired for his superb depictions of dramatic landscapes of the Dells of the Wisconsin River and also for his many technical innovations in photography, including a stop-action shutter and a revolving solar printing house that is now housed at the Smithsonian Institution. With his instantaneous shutter, he gained recognition for his striking images of moving subjects, such as lumber raftsmen shooting the river rapids and his son Ashley leaping in midair from a bluff to the craggy pillar of Stand Rock. Less well-known are Bennett&#x2019;s splendid urban photographs of nineteenth-century Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This engaging biography of H. H. Bennett tells his life story, illustrated throughout with his remarkable photographs, some of them rarely viewed before. It draws on the photographer&#x2019;s own letters and journals, along with other family documents, to portray the sweep of his career and personal life. An important figure in the history of photography, he also contributed to the growth of American tourism: his nationally distributed stereoscopic views of Dells rock formations and his portraits of local Ho-Chunk Indians played a significant role in creating the Wisconsin Dells as the popular tourist destination it is today. Despite personal challenges&#x2014;a crippling Civil War injury, the death of his first wife, and continual financial worries&#x2014;Bennett produced an extensive portfolio that captures the midwestern culture of his time. He accepted commissions in the 1890s to document Chicago&#x2019;s modern skyscrapers, grand residences of Milwaukee&#x2019;s entrepreneurs and sailing ships in its harbor, enormous scenic panoramas along the routes of Wisconsin railroads, and sparkling ice palaces lit by fireworks at the St. Paul Winter Carnival.</p><p>Finalist, Midwest Regional Interest, Midwest Book Awards</p></p><p><p>Sara Rath is author of the novels <i>Star Lake Saloon and Housekeeping Cottages</i> and <i>Night Sisters</i>, both published by Terrace Books.

Visit her at GenaShowalter.com.Gr 10 Up&#x2014;In this sequel to Firstlife, Tenley "Ten" Lockwood has chosen her allegiance to the otherworld realm Troika, much to the dismay of the Myriad realm. When the book opens, Ten is training to be a Conduit for Troika, an important position responsible for the light that powers the souls in the kingdom. Ten's ultimate goal, however, is to end the war between Troika and Myriad&#x2014;a complicated task, considering that her love, Killian, is aligned with Myriad, and neither side wants to concede. When a plot goes awry and uncovers a mole in Troika, Ten stops at nothing to rescue her friends from the Myriad clutches and convince both sides to cease their fire. Her heart says Killian is loyal to her and not to Myriad, but her head says differently. Interspersed between the chapters are emails between various officials of the realms, again hinting at possible betrayals and setups. At the end, readers are left with a semblance of hope and an extensive list of work to be done, setting up the third book in this trilogy nicely. The otherworld realms contain numerous intricate politics and rules; a new rule or policy is introduced in almost every chapter. Still, this is a fast-paced fantasy, and familiarity with Firstlife isn't necessary to get caught up with all the happenings in each of the various worlds. Told in Ten's stream-of-consciousness voice, the narrative includes quite a few graphic descriptions of violent deaths and some hot-and-heavy scenes between Killian and Ten. VERDICT This gripping, stand-alone entry in the series will captivate fantasy readers, especially fans of Sarah J. Maas's A Court of Thorns and Roses and Susan Dennard's Truthwitch.&#x2014;Amanda C.

In fact, few of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence and drafted the U.S. Constitution had ever seen a public school, and yet they benefited from a free system of education vastly superior to the imagined benefits of today&#39;s state-controlled schooling. What happened over the course of the last and a half centuries? Why did Americans surrender the educational freedom that produced such widespread academic excellence to embrace a state of functional illiteracy under complete government control? In his seminal book Is Public Education Necessary?, Samuel Blumenfeld unpacks two centuries of source material to present an accurate history of the religious and philosophical transformations that gave birth to the educational statism controlling America&#39;s children today. From the New England Puritan experiments in compulsory schooling to the Unitarian crusades to perfect man with the &#34;strong arm of government&#34;, Blumenfeld shows that public education in America has always been more about religion than literacy. A colorful history full of fascinating characters and incisive commentary, Is Public Education Necessary? challenges American parents to discard the common wisdom concerning public schools to reshoulder the responsibilities that are rightfully theirs, to fight to keep the liberties they inherited, and to teach their children to do the same.</p><p>About the author: Samuel L. Blumenfeld is the author of nine books on education, including How to Tutor (1978), NEA:Trojan Horse in American Education (1984), The Victims of Dick &amp; Jane and Other Essays (2003), and Revolution via Education (2009). A popular lecturer all over the world, Mr. Blumenfeld was educated in New York City public schools and had taught in both the public and private spheres. He lives in suburban Boston and continues to contribute to such publications as Reason, The New American, The New York Times, The Chalcedon Report, and Education Digest.</p><h2>Codex Sinaiticus: The Discovery of the World&#39;s Oldest Bible</h2><p><p>The author, Constantine Tischendorf, was one of the world's leading biblical scholars of his time. He spent much of his life searching for ancient biblical manuscripts, with his primary goal being to provide the world with the earliest scriptures in existence. Starting in 1844 Tischedorf's greatest discovery was made. While visiting St. Catherine's monastery in the Sinai, he found what would later be confirmed as the oldest complete New Testament bible ever found. Most of the Old Testament was included as well. This book is his entire first-hand account of this amazing discovery, followed by his assessment of its historical importance. It took him three trips, altogether, to convince those in the monastery to trust him and allow this bible to be shared with the world. Most of it was brought to Russia, but it was later sold to the British Museum in 1933 after they bought it from the Russian government for 100,000 British pounds. <em>The Mount Sinai Manuscript of the Bible</em>, also included here in this Book Tree published edition, was written shortly after the arrival of the manuscript in England. It outlines the known history of this bible and its importance to the world. Today, after years of study by scholars, this codex has revealed what the original scriptures may have looked like and what portions could have been later added.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Story of Redemption: A Concise Presentation of the Conflict of the Ages Drawn From the Earlier Writings of Ellen G.

Two red dots, quivering slightly, danced right over my heart.<br>&#x201c;You are one second away from death,&#x201d; said the caller.<br><br><b>Chapter Two</b><br><br>Starbox Coffee<br>Tehran, Iran<br>June 15, 7:25 a.m.<br>I didn&#x2019;t know the voice. She was a stranger. I didn&#x2019;t know her name. Didn&#x2019;t know anything except that she had my cell number. Ten seconds ago I was about to go into Starbox&#x2014;yes, they really call it that in Iran&#x2014;for a cup of bold and a couple of pastries. The street outside was empty.<br>I looked up. The shooters had to be in the building across the street, maybe the fifth floor. Didn&#x2019;t really matter, the range was a hundred yards and even a sloppy marksman could punch my ticket at that distance. I doubted these guys were sloppy. And there were two of them. I was also pretty sure I knew why they were after me.<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;I need you to confirm your name,&#x201d; she said in Persian. She had a very sexy voice for a psycho killer. Low and smoky.<br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because I have to be certain.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Geez, sister,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;if this is how you ID your targets then I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re going to get that contract killer merit badge.&#x201d;<br>The joke didn&#x2019;t translate well but she made a sound. It might have been a laugh. Glad she was amused. Sweat was pouring down my spine. The two little laser sights gave me no chance at all to run.<br>&#x201c;If this was simply a matter of killing you,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;then we&#x2019;d have done it and taken your wallet for identification.&#x201d; She had a European accent but she was hiding it by trying to speak Persian like a native. Kind of weird. Not the weirdest thing going on at the moment.<br>&#x201c;Um&nbsp;... thanks?&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Tell me your name,&#x201d; she said again.<br>There had to be three of them. Two shooters and her. Was she the spotter? If not, there could have been one or two others, spotting for the gunmen. Or it might have been the three of them.<br>&#x201c;Ebenezer Scrooge,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;No games,&#x201d; she warned. &#x201c;Your name.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Joe.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Full name.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Joseph.&#x201d;<br>One of the laser sights drifted down from my chest and settled on my crotch.<br>&#x201c;Once more?&#x201d; she coaxed.<br>&#x201c;Joseph Edwin Ledger.&#x201d; No screwing around this time.<br>&#x201c;Rank?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Rank?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Captain. Want my shoe size?&#x201d;<br>There was a pause. &#x201c;I was warned about you. You think you&#x2019;re funny.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Everyone thinks I&#x2019;m funny.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I doubt that&#x2019;s true. How often do you make Mr. Church laugh out loud?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Never heard of him,&#x201d; I lied.<br>Now I was confused. Up till now I thought she was part of a team looking to take me down for the little bit of nastiness I got into last night. Echo Team and I went into a high-security facility and liberated three twentysomethings who had been arrested a year ago while hiking in the mountains. The <i>Iraqi</i> mountains. An Iranian patrol crossed the border, nabbed the hikers, and started making noise in the media that the three hikers had illegally trespassed and therefore they were spies. They weren&#x2019;t. One was a former Peace Corps team leader who was there with his animal behaviorist girlfriend who wanted to take photos of a kind of rare tiger to help her with her master&#x2019;s thesis. <i>Acinonyx jubatus venaticus</i>. Asiatic cheetah. Also known as the Iranian cheetah. No, I&#x2019;m not making this up.<br>The hikers had been used as pawns in Iran&#x2019;s ongoing policy of stalling and disinformation regarding their nuclear program. Normally we&#x2019;d let the State Department and world opinion exert pressure on the Iranian government&nbsp;... but the third member of the hiking party was the only son of one of America&#x2019;s most important senators. The real twist is that the senator was a key player on several committees crucial to the U.S. war effort. Everyone with a spoonful of brains knew that the Iranians staged the whole thing to be able to turn dials on Senator McHale.<br>And it was starting to work. So the president asked Church to make the problem go away. We were Church&#x2019;s response.<br>&#x201c;So, who gets to slap the cuffs on me?&#x201d; I asked.<br>This time she did laugh.<br>&#x201c;No, Captain Ledger,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;here&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s going to work. As soon as I am done speaking you will turn off your cell phone and remove the battery and the SIM card. Put the SIM card and phone into different pockets. Walk to the curb and drop the battery into the culvert. Then I want you to go into the cafï¿½. Order a coffee, sit in the corner. Do not reassemble your phone. Do not use the store&#x2019;s phone. Write no notes to the staff or other customers. Sit and enjoy your coffee. Read the newspaper. Ahmadinejad is insisting that the dramatics at the prison last night were the result of a boiler explosion. You should find that amusing. Do not make any calls. Maybe have a second cup of coffee.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you work for Starbox? If so, I can&#x2019;t say I dig your new marketing strategy.&#x201d;<br>She ignored me. Her resistance to my wit was almost as disconcerting as the laser sights on my junk. Almost.<br>She said, &#x201c;In a few minutes a person will enter the cafï¿½. A man. He will recognize you and will join you. The two of you will have a conversation and then he will leave. Once he has left, you will wait another ten minutes before you reassemble your phone. You are on your own to find a new battery. You are supposed to be resourceful, so I imagine you will solve that problem without my advice.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then what do I do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you will do whatever you judge best.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When do I meet you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said with another little laugh, &#x201c;you would not.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tell me something, miss, why go to these lengths? This could have been arranged with a lot less drama.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No it could not. If you are smarter than you appear, then you&#x2019;ll understand why in a few minutes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;These laser sights going to be on me the whole time? It&#x2019;s a lousy fashion statement and people <i>will</i> talk.&#x201d;<br>There was a moment&#x2019;s silence on the other end and then both sights vanished. I had to control myself from collapsing against the wall. I was pretty sure it would be two or three weeks before my nuts felt safe enough to climb down out of my chest cavity. My heart was beating like a jazz drum solo&#x2014;loud, fast, and with no discernable rhythm.<br>&#x201c;The clock is now ticking, Captain Ledger. Once I disconnect, please follow the instructions you have been given.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wait&#x2014;&#x201d; I said, but the line went dead.<br>I held the phone in my hand and looked across the street to the office building. Even without the sights I knew they could take me anytime they wanted.<br>There were no real options left. Just because the laser sights weren&#x2019;t on me didn&#x2019;t mean that I was safe. I think they&#x2019;d used them for effect. It was broad daylight; they certainly had scopes. So I did as I was told. I dismantled my phone and put the SIM card in my left coat pocket and the empty phone casing in my jeans. With great reluctance I walked to the edge of the pavement and stared for a moment down into the black hole of the culvert.<br>&#x201c;Crap,&#x201d; I said, and dropped the battery, which vanished without a trace. All I heard was a dull <i>plop</i> as it landed in the subterranean muck.<br>Before I turned to go into the store I scratched the tip of my nose with my forefinger.

Yet Walter cannot steer clear of love trouble, and despite his enforced solitude, Alan is still surrounded by women: his powerful sister, an old flame, and an animal lover named Saga, who grapples with demons all her own. As for Greenie, living in the shadow of a charismatic politician leads to a series of unforeseen consequences that separate her from her only child. We watch as folly, chance, and determination pull all these lives together and apart over a year that culminates in the fall of the twin towers at the World Trade Center, an event that will affirm or confound the choices each character has made&#x2014;or has refused to face.<br><br>Julia Glass is at her best here, weaving a glorious tapestry of lives and lifetimes, of places and people, revealing the subtle mechanisms behind our most important, and often most fragile, connections to others.

Until recently a longtime New Yorker, she now lives with her family in Massachusetts.Chapter 1: <br>A Piece of Cake<br>The call came on the twenty-ninth of february: the one day in four years when, according to antiquated custom, women may openly choose their partners without shame. As Greenie checked her e-mail at work that morning, a small pink box popped up on the screen: Carpe diem, ladies! Scotland, according to her cheery, avuncular service provider, passed a law in 1288 that if a man refused a woman&#x2019;s proposal on this day, he must pay a fine: anything from a kiss to money that would buy her a silk dress or a fancy pair of gloves.<br><br> If I weren&#x2019;t hitched already, thought Greenie, I would gladly take rejection in exchange for a lovely silk dress. Oh for the quiet, sumptuous ease of a silk dress; oh for the weather in which to wear it!<br><br> Yet again it was sleeting. Greenie felt as if it had been sleeting for a week. The sidewalks of Bank Street, tricky enough in their skewed antiquity, were now glazed with ice, so that walking George to school had become a chore of matronly scolding and pleading: &#x201c;Walk, honey. Please walk. What did I say, did I say WALK?&#x201d; Like most four-year-old boys, George left his house like a pebble from a slingshot, careening off parked cars, brownstone gates, fences placed to protect young trees (apparently not just from urinating dogs), and pedestrians prickly from too little coffee or too much workaday dread.<br><br> Greenie was just shaking off the ill effects of what she called VD whiplash: VD as in Valentine&#x2019;s Day, an occasion that filled her with necessary inspiration as January waned, yet left her in its wake&#x2014;if business was good&#x2014;vowing she would never, ever again bake anything shaped like a heart or a cherub or put so much as a drop of carmine dye in a bowl of buttercream icing.<br><br> As if to confirm her fleeting disenchantment with all that stood for romantic love, she and Alan had had another of the fruitless, bitter face-offs Greenie could never seem to avoid&#x2014;and which, in their small apartment, she feared would awaken and worry George. This one had kept her up till two in the morning. She hadn&#x2019;t bothered to go to bed, since Tuesday was one of the days on which she rose before dawn to bake brioche, scones, cinnamon rolls, and&#x2014;Tuesdays only&#x2014;a coffee cake rich with cardamom, orange zest, and grated gingerroot: a cunningly savory sweet that left her work kitchen smelling like a fine Indian restaurant, a brief invigorating change from the happily married scents of butter, vanilla, and sugar (the fragrance, to Greenie, of ordinary life).<br><br> Dead on her feet by ten in the morning, she had forgotten the telephone message she&#x2019;d played back the evening before: &#x201c;Greenie dear, I believe you&#x2019;ll be getting a call from a VIP tomorrow; I won&#x2019;t say who and I won&#x2019;t say why, but I want it on the record that it was I who told him what a genius you are. Though I&#x2019;ve just now realized that he may spirit you away! Idiot me, what was I thinking! So call me, you have to promise you&#x2019;ll call me the minute you hear from the guy. Bya!&#x201d; Pure Walter: irritating, affectionate, magnanimous, coy. &#x201c;Vee Aye Pee,&#x201d; he intoned breathlessly, as if she were about to get a call from the Pope. More likely some upstate apple grower who&#x2019;d tasted her pie and was trolling for recipes to include in one of those springbound charity cookbooks that made their way quickly to yard sales and thrift shops. Or maybe this: the Director of Cheesecake from Junior&#x2019;s had tasted hers&#x2014;a thousandfold superior to theirs&#x2014;and wanted to give her a better-paid but deadly monotonous job in some big seedy kitchen down in Brooklyn. What, in Walter&#x2019;s cozy world, constituted a VIP?<br><br> Walter was the owner and gadabout host (not the chef; he couldn&#x2019;t have washed a head of lettuce to save his life) of a retro-American tavern that served high-cholesterol, high-on-the-food-chain meals with patriarchal hubris. Aptly if immodestly named, Walter&#x2019;s Place felt like a living room turned pub. On the ground floor of a brownstone down the street from Greenie&#x2019;s apartment, it featured two fireplaces, blue-checked tablecloths, a fashionably weary velvet sofa, and (Board of Health be damned) a roving bulldog named The Bruce. (As in Robert the Bruce? Greenie had wondered but never asked; more likely the dog was named after some fetching young porn star, object of Walter&#x2019;s cheerfully futile longing. He&#x2019;d never been too explicit about such longings, but he made allusions.) Greenie wasn&#x2019;t wild about the Eisenhower-era foods with which Walter indulged his customers&#x2014;indulgence, she felt, was the province of dessert&#x2014;but she had been pleased when she won the account. Over the past few years, she had come to think of Walter as an ally more than a client.<br><br> Except for the coconut cake (filled with Meyer lemon curd and glazed with brown sugar), most of the desserts she made for Walter were not her best or most original, but they were exemplars of their kind: portly, solid-citizen desserts, puddings of rice, bread, and noodles&#x2014;sweets that the Pilgrims and other humble immigrants who had scraped together their prototypes would have bartered in a Mayflower minute for Greenie&#x2019;s blood-orange mousse, pear ice cream, or tiny white-chocolate ï¿½clairs. Walter had also commissioned a deep-dish apple pie, a strawberry marble cheesecake, and a layer cake he asked her to create exclusively for him. &#x201c;Everybody expects one of those, you know, death-by-chocolate things on a menu like mine, but what I want is massacre by chocolate, execution by chocolate&#x2014;firing squad by chocolate!&#x201d; he told her.<br><br> So that very night, after tucking George in bed, Greenie had returned to the kitchen where she made her living, in a basement two blocks from her home, and stayed up till morning to birth a four-layer cake so dense and muscular that even Walter, who could have benched a Shetland pony, dared not lift it with a single hand. It was the sort of dessert that appalled Greenie on principle, but it also embodied a kind of uberprosperity, a transgressive joy, flaunting the potential heft of butter, that Protean substance as wondrous and essential to a pastry chef as fire had been to early man.<br><br> Walter christened the cake Apocalypse Now; Greenie held her tongue. By itself, this creation doubled the amount of cocoa she ordered from her supplier every month. After it was on his menu for a week, Walter bet her a lobster dinner that before a year was out, Gourmet would request the recipe, putting both of them on a wider culinary map. If that came to pass, Greenie would surrender to the vagaries of fleeting fame, but right now the business ran as smoothly as she could have hoped. She had a diligent assistant and an intern who shopped, cleaned up, made deliveries, and showed up on time. The amount of work they all shared felt just right to Greenie; she could not have taken an order for one more tiny ï¿½clair without enlarging the enterprise to a degree where she feared she would begin to lose control. Alan said that what she really feared was honestly growing up, taking her lifelong ambition and molding it into a Business with a capital B. Greenie resented his condescension; if Business with a capital B was the goal of growing up, what was he doing as a private psychotherapist working out of a back-door bedroom that should have belonged to George, who slept in an alcove off their living room meant for a dining room table? Which brought up the subject of George: was Alan unhappy that Greenie&#x2019;s work, on its present scale, allowed her to spend more time with their son than a Business with a capital B would have done?<br><br> &#x201c;Delegation,&#x201d; said Alan. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called delegation.&#x201d;<br><br> This was the sort of bickering that passed too often now between them, and if Greenie blamed Alan for starting these quarrels, she blamed herself for plunging into the fray. Stubbornly, she refused to back down for the sake of greater domestic harmony or to address the underlying dilemma. The overlying dilemma, that much was clear. Through the past year, as Greenie began to turn away clients, Alan was losing them. His schedule had dwindled to half time, and the extra hours it gave him with George did not seem to console him.<br><br> Alan, two years away from forty, had reached what Greenie privately conceived of as the Peggy Lee stage in life: Is That All There Is? Greenie did not know what to do about this. She would have attacked the problem head on if the sufferer had been one of her girlfriends, but Alan was a man, chronically resentful of direction. When he was with friends, his argumentative nature was his strength, a way of challenging the world and its complacencies, but in private&#x2014;alone with Greenie&#x2014;he fell prey to defensiveness and nocturnal nihilism. She had known this before they married, but she had assumed this aspect of his psyche would burn off, under the solar exposure of day-to-day affection, like cognac set aflame in a skillet. Next year they would be married ten years, and it had not.<br><br> In their first years together, she had loved the wakefulness they shared late at night. After sex, Alan did not tumble into a callow sleep, the way most men claimed they could not resist doing. Like Greenie, he would be alert for another half hour or more. They would talk about their days, their dreams (both sleeping and waking), their notions on the fate of mankind. When it came to worldly matters, the voice of doubt would be Alan&#x2019;s&#x2014;mourning or raging that genocide would never end, that presidents would never be moral, that children would always be abducted by men who would never be caught&#x2014;but he was invariably passionate, and back then, Greenie saw hope in that passion. He loved Greenie expressively, eloquently, in a way she felt...</p><h2>All Souls: A Family Story from Southie (Ballantine Reader&#39;s Circle)</h2><p>Michael Patrick MacDonald grew up in &#34;the best place in the world&#34;--the Old Colony projects of South Boston--where 85% of the residents collect welfare in an area with the highest concentration of impoverished whites in the U.S. In All Souls, MacDonald takes us deep into the secret heart of Southie. With radiant insight, he opens up a contradictory world, where residents are besieged by gangs and crime but refuse to admit any problems, remaining fiercely loyal to their community. MacDonald also introduces us to the unforgettable people who inhabit this proud neighborhood. We meet his mother, Ma MacDonald, an accordion-playing, spiked-heel-wearing, indomitable mother to all; Whitey Bulger, the lord of Southie, gangster and father figure, protector and punisher; and Michael&#39;s beloved siblings, nearly half of whom were lost forever to drugs, murder, or suicide.

(Winner of the Kurt Maschler Award); Jolly Rodger (Winner of the British Book Awards (Children&#39;s Books)); the poetry collections Who&#39;s Been Sleeping in My Porridge? and Wish You Were Here (And I Wasn&#39;t), and several stroies about a pig called Preston. Colin is married with two sons and lives in London.Kindergarten-Grade 3?Maisie Pickles's parents hustle her off to Captain Abdul's Pirate School to toughen her up because she likes writing poems and painting pictures. She learns her lessons so well that when she overhears a plot to kidnap the students and hold them for ransom, she deftly organizes a mutiny. After subduing the teaching staff, the youngsters set sail for the West Indies and live a boisterously adventurous life, stealing from pirates and sending the treasure home. Captain Abdul reckons his school a success to have graduated such a crew, and Maisie herself is free to pursue her artistic interests. McNaughton's bold cartoons are well suited to the subject. His pirates convey just the right robust exaggeration; bold lines express exuberant movement and attitude. The text, written in the form of Maisie's diary, gives the impression of hand lettering on parchment and is spiced with lusty dialogue. The book is rife with broad humor. The student body, while multiethnic, is definitely not P.C. While the characters' stereotypical identities play no real part in the story, librarians should be alerted to the fact that there are visual and verbal jokes and plays on words at the expense of everyone.

She is author of Railroad Noir: The American West at the End of the Twentieth Century (IUP, 2010).</p>This recollection of the author's ten years as a migratory brakeman for the railroad (a "boomer" who follows seasonal cycles of rush and recession around the country) can be appreciated on several levels. Certainly it is a remarkable adventure tale, the occupational odyssey of the Ph.D. in literature who immerses herself in blue-collar America. The book also reveals much about the state of the nation's railroads in the post-Reagan era: the hazards of the work, the safety violations, the compromises of the unions, the harrassment of women and minorities, the transient and often self-destructive lifestyles. At the same time, the author confronts herself, exploring her alcoholism and substance abuse; her difficulties with friends and lovers of both sexes; what it was in the life that attracted her in the first place; and more. The book does not conclude so much as stop, a chapter in an unfinished life. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Beverly Miller, Boise State Univ.

The recent discovery of a considerable number of letters and sermons by Augustine has thrown fresh light on the first and last decades of his experience as a bishop. These circumstantial texts have led Peter Brown to reconsider some of his judgements on Augustine, both as the author of the Confessions and as the elderly bishop preaching and writing in the last years of Roman rule in North Africa. Professor Brown&#39;s reflections on the significance of these new documents are contained in two chapters of a substantial epilogue to his biography (the text of which is unaltered). He also reviews the changes in scholarship about Augustine since the 1960s. There is a personal as well as a scholarly fascination in the book-length epilogue and notes that Professor Brown has added to his portrait of the Bishop of Hippo.</p><p><b>Peter Brown</b> is Rollins Professor of History at Princeton University.

Owen is regarded as one of the best poets of World War I and composed nearly all of his poems in just over a year, between August 1917 and September 1918. Owen was virtually unknown at the time of his death, yet his poetic account of a soldier&#39;s experience of war has shaped our impression of the horrors of the Western Front. This collection includes the well-known &#39;Anthem for Doomed Youth&#39; and &#39;Dulce et Decorum Est&#39;.</p><p>Of all the work bequeathed to us by that generation of young men who fought in the trenches, Owen&#39;s is the most remarkable for its breadth of sympathy and its understanding of human suffering and tenderness, at home and on the battlefield.Wilfred Owen (1893-1918) was one of the leading poets of the First World War. Brought up in Birkenhead and Shrewsbury, Owen worked as a lay assistant to the vicar of Dunsden before teaching in France the year before the war broke out. In 1915 he enlisted in the Artists Rifles and was wounded in combat in 1917. Recovering from concussion and shell shock in an Edinburgh hospital, Owen met another patient, the poet Siegfried Sassoon, who became his mentor. At this time Owen wrote many of his greatest poems including &#39;Anthem for Doomed Youth&#39;. In June 1918 Owen returned to France and was awarded the Military Cross for bravery.

This river, the longest in the world, flowed through the desert, bringing life in its floodwater every year. Where did all this water come from? Christopher Ondaatje, long fascinated with Richard Burton and wishing to relive his 1856 African exploration, prepared for this journey by studying the expeditions of several Victorian travellers, for each had returned with part of the answer to the Nile&#39;s riddle. In 1996 Ondaatje followed the Victorian explorers&#39; routes, to see for himself what they had seen. Although acutely aware that their claims of &#34;discovering&#34; a mountain or river were ridiculous, he quickly realized that he was indeed on a journey of discovery, and that the search for truth is often about finding new and better questions, not just answers. His trek across the Serengeti Plains to Olduvai Gorge provides the most striking revelation of all: the forces which shaped the Nile may also have triggered the evolution of the human race.</p><p><p> <b>Christopher Ondaatje</b> was born in Ceylon and educated in England.

To facilitate this deadly covert operation, professional courier Simon Leonidovich is recruited to deliver vital CIA documents to the North Korean dissidents. But when Simon finds himself trapped behind enemy lines with a briefcase full of incriminating evidence, he discovers the true nature of the threat: an elaborate conspiracy by someone within the administration -- to take down the American President. . . .</p><p>Jay MacLarty has been an entrepreneur since the age of twenty-one.

It was one of those little perks he would miss, all the bowing and scraping to his position. <i>Tucker Stark, Director of Central Intelligence</i>, he would miss that too. The job, the title -- everything. </p><p> <i>Christ Almighty</i>, how did it come to this? What if the President hadn't made that one slip of the tongue -- his acute interest in oil leases off the coast of Alaska -- and what if Tucker hadn't started to investigate? What if he hadn't found the offshore corporations, the hidden accounts, the bearer bonds, and the foreign depositories the President used to hide his ownership and illegal profiteering? Accounts buried so deep, hidden behind so many shell corporations and false names that no official investigation -- one that would need to abide by international regulations of confidentiality -- would ever uncover. </p><p> The young woman behind the reception desk, a uniformed Secret Service agent, grinned with chirpy enthusiasm. "Good afternoon, Mr. Director." </p><p> Tucker forced his thoughts back to the here and now and somehow managed to conjure up a smile. "Good afternoon." If only it was. </p><p> "You're looking very good today." </p><p> He knew better. Beneath his easy-fitting, summer-weight Armani suit, his six-foot, four-inch athletic body had started to go soft, a consequence of too many take-out meals since the death of his wife and children. For the first time since puberty, he looked older than his age -- fifty-six -- his hair having gone from black to steel gray in less than two years. "Thank you." </p><p> He scratched his name into the logbook and started down the hall, still questioning what he was about to do. But how could he not? Like it or not, he knew too much. And now that he understood the pattern, he could see how the President made financial decisions based on legislation he would either sign or veto. And worse, how he pushed for legislation simply to benefit his portfolio, even when it hurt the country. That was too much. <i>Way too much!</i> The man was a menace and had to be stopped. </p><p> Bette Ann Collins flashed an irritated scowl, just enough to let Tucker know this unscheduled late-afternoon visit was not appreciated. Though her title -- Personal Secretary to the President of the United States -- came with no special powers, Bette Ann was guard dog to the most powerful man in the world and wasn't shy about expressing her feelings, not even to the Director of Central Intelligence. "He's waiting." </p><p> Tucker didn't bother to respond -- if he had his way the old bitch would be working for an ex-President soon enough -- and pushed open the door to the Oval Office. John Paul Estes, the President's Chief of Staff, an unattractive man with more nervous tics and twitches than a hyperactive two-year-old, was pacing impatiently back and forth in front of the desk. The President was slumped in his chair, looking bored and anxious to escape his gilded cage. Tucker purposely ignored Estes -- it was a game they played, one of mutual disrespect -- and focused on the President. "Mr. President, thank you for seeing me on such short notice." </p><p> The President -- tall and urbane in a perfectly tailored bluish-gray worsted suit -- stood and extended his hand across the desk, a rosewood showpiece containing a stylish array of mementoes and photographs, and not a single file or scrap of paper. Just like the man, Tucker thought, all flash and facade. "No problem," the President said, showing his perfect and freshly whitened teeth. "No problem at all. The people's work must be done." </p><p> "I hope this is important," Estes said, "I've got a shit pile of reports I need to get through." </p><p> That Tucker believed. For all practical purposes, John Paul Estes ran the Executive branch of the government while the President campaigned, something he did sixteen hours a day, 365 days a year, election year or not. "When I call, Mr. Estes, you should pray it <i>isn't</i> important." </p><p> Estes smiled without humor and motioned toward one of the chairs facing the President's desk. "What's so critical it couldn't wait until morning?" </p><p> Tucker ignored the question and kept his eyes focused on the President. "I'm afraid it's a Red Issue, sir. Your ears only." </p><p> The President nodded with great solemnity -- the perfect visage of Presidential concern and attention -- and turned to his Chief of Staff. "I'm sorry, JP, you'll have to excuse us." </p><p> Estes expelled a long breath, letting Tucker know exactly how he felt about private conversations with the President. No one understood the man's intellectual limitations better than John Paul Estes, a secret he had diligently tried to protect for more than twenty-five years. "Is this really necessary?" </p><p> "I don't make the rules," Tucker answered. "If the President wants to share the information, that's up to him." </p><p> Estes recognized the trap immediately. If the President made such a decision before hearing the information he would look stupid, and if Estes insisted on sitting in, it would make the President look weak. "I'll be in my office." He gave the President a look, a secret exchange only the two of them understood. "Please call me when you're done." Despite the "please," it sounded more like an order than a request. </p><p> Tucker waited until the door closed before speaking. "I think we should move to your private office, sir." </p><p> "Oh?" A momentary look of confusion spread across the President's face, the time it took for him to grasp the implication, that this was not an Oval Office discussion, where conversations were routinely recorded. "Of course." For the first time he looked half interested, as if he expected Tucker to expose some juicy bit of political scandal. "Excellent idea." </p><p> That the President would assume it was "an excellent idea" only confirmed what Tucker now knew to be true: in addition to being an avaricious profiteer, the man had a room-temperature IQ -- and the sooner he was gone, the safer the country would be. </p><p> Though Tucker had been Director for nearly two years, it was his first visit to the small room where Clinton had his infamous tryst with Monica Lewinsky. That history and the voyeuristic image it conjured up was more interesting than the room itself, which was rather plain and unimpressive, the walls decorated with photographs of the President and world dignitaries. </p><p> The President circled around behind his desk -- a mahogany Chippendale style partners desk with drawers on both sides -- and settled into his chair, a tufted leather wingback. "Okay, Tuck, what's up?" </p><p> "It's bad news, Mr. President." Tucker opened his laptop, wanting to check his countersurveillance scanner before saying too much. "Very bad." </p><p> The President frowned, apparently realizing that when the Director of Central Intelligence said "very bad" he wasn't referring to some innocuous bit of political scandal. "I'm listening." </p><p> Satisfied there were no active listening devices, Tucker activated the recorder and positioned the laptop on the edge of the desk, where the microphone could easily pick up their conversation. "It's North Korea." </p><p> "Again! I thought we settled all that." </p><p> "Yessir, but I'm afraid we dramatically misjudged the situation." </p><p> The furrow between the President's perfectly plucked eyebrows deepened significantly. "We?" </p><p> Exactly the response Tucker expected -- the political response -- the only language the President understood. Not <i>how</i> or <i>why</i>, but an immediate attempt to distance himself from the epicenter of any problem. "The Agency, Mr. President. Contrary to all the assurances we've received, and what we believed -- " Tucker paused and took a deep breath. "We've now confirmed their nuclear program is not only active, but is much further along than we ever anticipated." </p><p> The wrinkles tightened around the President's eyes. "Define 'further along.'" </p><p> "Their efforts at miniaturization have been successful." </p><p> It was obvious from the President's expression he understood the ramifications. Without miniaturization America was relatively safe; a nuclear weapon was useless to any country without the missiles to deliver it, but once a bomb was miniaturized, it could be hidden and moved without limitation. "You're absolutely sure about this?" </p><p> "Yessir, we should have caught it earlier." Tucker tried his best to look appropriately contrite. "Much earlier." </p><p> "This is very bad news, Director. Very bad." </p><p> Tucker noted the shift from Tuck to Director, but that too was expected. "It gets worse." </p><p> The President rolled his hand impatiently. "Continue." </p><p> "It's on the street." </p><p> "On the street? You mean they're actually trying to sell the damn thing?" </p><p> "To anyone with money. And I mean anyone. Al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah -- " </p><p> "They wouldn't dare." </p><p> They both knew that wasn't true; North Korea was one of the biggest arms dealers in the world, and they didn't get that way by judging the moral standards or intentions of their clients. "Yessir, I'm afraid they would." </p><p> The President shook his head angrily. "Christ Almighty, I guess we all knew it would come to this eventually." </p><p> "Yessir." </p><p> "You're absolutely sure?" he asked again, clearly hoping for a different answer. </p><p> "Yessir. One hundred percent." </p><p> "That's what you said about Iraq and WMD." </p><p> "That wasn't on my watch, sir." </p><p> "A distinction I doubt the UN will find convincing." </p><p> "The UN, sir?" </p><p> "Of course the UN," the President answered without any hesitation or doubt. "They're the ones who will have to handle this thing." </p><p> Tucker nodded, being careful to show only the slightest disapproval. "Yessir." </p><p> The President opened his mouth, then hesitated, a look of uncertainty creeping into his eyes. "You don't agree?" </p><p> "You said it yourself," Tucker answered, trying to make his disagreem...</p></p><h2>The Maharajah&#39;s General (Jack Lark)</h2><p><p><b>In<i> The Maharajah's General</i> by Paul Fraser Collard Jack Lark returns to the battlefield under a new name to face greater adventures in a brutal land.</b> <b>A must-read for fans of Bernard Cornwell and Simon Scarrow.

At school, Paul was determined to become an officer in the British army and he succeeded in winning an Army Scholarship. However, Paul chose to give up his boyhood ambition and instead went into the finance industry. Paul stills works in the City, and lives with his wife and three children in Kent.It's not since I first picked up <i>Sharpe's Eagle</i> that a single character captured my imagination so totally, this supported by a fast fluid pace of writing, and a vivid portrayal of the Indian country, people, time period, the east India company and as usual the brutal, uncompromising and occasionally morally bankrupt officer corps coupled with the efficiency of the ordinary men of the British army, all this condensed into 336 pages of explosive action, violent emotions, uncompromising unbending discipline and a man with the courage to do what is right&#x2015;<b><i>Parmenion Books</i></b><br><br>The story is well written with some very comprehensive descriptions of both people and their surroundings.

Rich in anecdote and insight, <strong></strong><strong><em>Vested Interests</em></strong><strong></strong> offers a provocative and entertaining view of our ongoing obsession with dressing up--and with the power of clothes.</p><p>Director of the Humanities Center at HarvardAn elaborate theory by Garber (English/Harvard), insisting that the transvestite is at the elusive heart of Western culture. In a century-sweeping book, Garber applies current critical thought to the phenomenon of ``cross-dressing'' in fact and fiction, high culture and low. Arguing that gender is culturally constructed, she contends that cross-dressing challenges the binary categories of male and female as well as the concept of category itself. It signals ``cultural, social or aesthetic dissonances.'' Garber argues that critics have looked ``through,'' not ``at,'' the transvestite, failing to see what is a Freudian ``primal scene.'' Defined here again and again, the transvestite is ``the space of desire,'' ``a space of possibility,'' a ``third.'' Garber plays out her theory in detailed analyses of countless transvestite figures- -Shakespearean heroines, Tootsie, Lawrence of Arabia, M. Butterfly, Madonna, and Laurence Olivier (here portrayed at death as ``the triumphant transvestite''). There is no shortage of provocative speculation and information, some worth considering and some--like that about transvestite magazines and the politics of transsexual surgery--not. Unfortunately, the sub-flooring of French critical terms sets Garber's argument on a slippery slope ending up too often in a theoretical mire where ``the transvestite is both a signifier and that which signifies the undecidability of signification.'' A discussion of Elizabethan dress codes and costuming concludes with the typically reductive claim that ``there is no ground of Shakespeare that is not already cross-dressed.'' Also, when critical terms are rampantly applied--Elvis and Liberace, for instance, labeled, like Peter Pan, ``changeling boys''--they quickly lose impact. Bound for controversy, this study admirably attempts to cross from the academy to popular culture, but theory here acts less as a window onto cultural evolution than as a screen drawing attention its own overwrought, repetitive pattern.

It invites young leaders and all people to study humanity&#39;s African roots and the ancient and healing wisdom of African traditions. Within the contemporary intellectual-spiritual renaissance of African roots, the book highlights the creation-oriented spirituality of Africa, so full of joy and praise. It summarizes the scientific story of our human family&#39;s birth in ancient Africa, and our human family&#39;s subsequent migratory journey across the entire planet. It points out the African roots of civilization, of spirituality, and of the roles of women and men, all of which may still be partially reflected across today?s human cultures. The book argues that we humans form a single human family guided by common philosophical-ethical truths seminally present in ancient African wisdom. It argues that these truths are grounded in the nature and purpose of everything in the created world, including humanity. We humans are not separated into radically different races. Nor are we separated from the rest of Nature. Rather, we form one human family within the natural world and we seek a common Global Ethics for ourselves and for the natural world of which we are an organic part. The book invites young leaders and all people to work together in healing the great spiritual, ecological, and social breakdowns that have developed from following the false philosophical wisdom of the mechanical-utilitarian cosmology at the foundation of modern Western industrial-colonial civilization. This misguided cosmology constitutes the deep intellectual root of late modern Western culture&#39;s promotion of selfish individualism, ecological destruction, and spiritual emptiness. Drawing on African wisdom, the book seeks to help young leaders, and others, to develop a healing global vision for ecological, social, and spiritual regeneration. The book may be used for college and high-school classes, for adult study groups, or for individual study.

Her marriage to Henry I of England in 1100 thus brought to Henry, descendant of the conquering Normans, a direct and politically desirable link to Matilda&#39;s ancestor Alfred the Great. Her life makes clear that Matilda had outstanding talents. She was educated in the exclusive convents of Romsey and Wilton, a grounding which enabled her to further the literate court culture of the twelfth century, and under her control was a substantial demesne that allowed her to exercise both lay and ecclesiastical patronage. In the matter of ruling, she was an active partner in administering Henry&#39;s cross-channel realm, served as a member of his curia regis, and on occasion acted with what amounted to vice-regal authority in England while Henry was in Normandy. Chroniclers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries often refer to her as Mathilda bona regina, or Matildis beatae memoriae, and for a time she was popularly regarded as a saint. Huneycutt&#39;s study shows how Matilda achieved such acclaim, both because the political structures of her day allowed her the opportunity to do so and because she herself was skilled at manipulating those structures. This study will be valuable to those interested in not only English political history, but also to historians of women, the medieval church, and medieval culture.

The pharmaceutical and surgical options that are available have significant side effects and only correct symptoms for a limited period of time. Even with the best conventional treatment, the disease progresses and becomes severely disabling. No existing conventional therapies that the progress of the disease; available medicines only treat symptoms temporarily. Conventional medicine views the course of the disease as &#34;progressive&#34; and &#34;irreversible.&#34; Many patients, who are only partially satisfied with conventional medicine, seek alternative and complementary options in an attempt to slow, stop, or reverse the disease process. This book has several functions: - It is a science-based reference manual. - It is inspiring and empowering to patients. - It is educational for both patients and neurologists. - It is entertaining. - It fosters an understanding between conventional and complementary providers.

Bats most naturally hang upside down and are good at it. Murray was a bit of a show-off anyway, so he swung by his toes whenever anyone passing by happened to look up.<br> <br>Murray was Stumpy&#x2019;s tree mate, best friend, and self-appointed uncle to her three children: Sparrow, Top, and Bottom. And he could be a very naughty influence, as when he taught the children to hang by their toes, and they drew all sorts of remarks from the park residents as a result.<br> <br>Most remarks were kind, as when Old Badger said she had never seen such clever squirrels in all her days.<br> <br><br> <br>Some remarks were neutral, as when the raven simply commented that toes were neither good nor bad, they just were.<br> <br>And a few remarks were plainly mean and of course issued forth from the mouths of the weasels, every one of whom remarked that it would probably be a good idea if a certain squirrel mother taught her children some etiquette.<br> <br>&#x201c;Etiquette?&#x201d; repeated Murray when Stumpy told him about this insult. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that where New Yorkers go for the weekend?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Stumpy, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s Connecticut. Etiquette is manners.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Manners!&#x201d; shrieked Murray, who enjoyed drama. &#x201c;Manners! If I had manners, I&#x2019;d starve!&#x201d;<br> <br>(Murray was referring to the fact that he regularly pilfered egg rolls from the Dumpster by the Chinese restaurant down the street. And doughnuts from the bakery Dumpster on the other side of the park. And enchiladas from the Taco Craze Dumpster over by the freeway. The list could go on for miles.)<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Stumpy, &#x201c;mothers are sensitive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And weasels are rats,&#x201d; said Murray. &#x201c;Rats in weasel clothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stumpy sighed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gwendolyn would understand,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Gwendolyn understands everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>Murray nodded in agreement.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s because she&#x2019;s a hundred and four years old,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;She is not!&#x201d; cried Stumpy. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just wise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gwendolyn is wise and a hundred and four years old,&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are counting all her past lives she told us about,&#x201d; said Stumpy. &#x201c;In hermit crab time Gwendolyn is just, well, she is just . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A hundred and four,&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, for goodness&#x2019; sake,&#x201d; said Stumpy.<br> <br>Gwendolyn was Stumpy and Murray&#x2019;s dear, dear friend. They could not imagine how they had ever managed without her. Gwendolyn might be a hermit crab, but she understood each of them perfectly. She gave Stumpy&#x2014;who was something of a worrier&#x2014;the very best advice about rearing young children. (Gwendolyn&#x2019;s advice always solved the problem.) And Gwendolyn praised Murray&#x2019;s heart, which was actually quite a big heart, but one that Murray hid behind a million funny lines.<br> <br>Gwendolyn never let her bat friend get away with this.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are a shining emblem of love to those children,&#x201d; Gwendolyn often said to Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;A shining plum?&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;A shining emblem,&#x201d; said Gwendolyn.<br> <br>&#x201c;A shiny Indian?&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emblem,&#x201d; said Gwendolyn.<br> <br>&#x201c;Envelope?&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, for goodness&#x2019; sake,&#x201d; said Gwendolyn.<br> <br>But Murray really did hear her. And it made him proud.<br> <br><br> <br>The true hero among them all, of course, was the one who said very little about love or courage or wisdom but excelled at all three. And this true hero&#x2019;s name was Kona.<br> <br>Kona was a chocolate Labrador who lived a quiet dog&#x2019;s life with Gwendolyn and their human, Professor Albert.<br> <br>It had been well over a year since Kona had faced the greatest challenge of his life by rescuing Stumpy&#x2019;s three children. This had happened during a most terrifying ice storm that ravaged the trees of Gooseberry Park, among those the great pin oak where Stumpy&#x2019;s babies had just been born.<br> <br>With Murray&#x2019;s help, and Gwendolyn&#x2019;s help, Kona managed to hide the children he had rescued by placing them in the Christmas decorations in Professor Albert&#x2019;s basement until Stumpy&#x2014;who had gone missing in the storm&#x2014;was found.<br> <br><br> <br>It was during this time that Murray developed a strong attachment to television and Oreo cookies. Both were still central to his life. And he had since then sneaked into Professor Albert&#x2019;s house on warm summer days&#x2014;easing open the screen door with his sneaky little foot&#x2014;so he could have a cookie and watch Jeopardy! with Gwendolyn. Professor Albert was usually napping in the hammock.<br> <br>So life for these fine friends and for Professor Albert had been very rich since the ice storm, and the three squirrel babies&#x2014;once sheltered by a chocolate Labrador and a hermit crab in a human&#x2019;s house&#x2014;had grown taller and rounder and stronger. And they could hang by their toes.<br> <br>Life had been very rich and very quiet.<br> <br>But the very quiet part was about to change.</p><h2>Children at War</h2><p>Analyzes the growing use of children as soldiers in global conflicts, explaining how youngsters are recruited and abducted, indoctrinated, trained, and utilized as warriors; how changes in weapons technology and a breakdown of global order have led to the phenomenon; and how Western armies can prepare themselves. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Over six million child combatants were killed or injured in the past decade. In this groundbreaking and comprehensive study, Singer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and former adviser to the U.S. military, explores the rise and expansion of child soldiery. Children, Singer finds, enter armies and militias in numerous ways: as voluntary soldiers, indoctrinated to kill; as involuntary soldiers, forced into the militia or military by cruel adults; as child-terrorists; as members of all-child armies (such as the Hitler Youth); and as sexual slaves for superior officers. Singer (<i>Corporate Warriors</i>) explores different means of training and indoctrination, often through interviews with child-soldiers, as well as with adults who have fought against them and others who have tried to rehabilitate children forced into warfare. In the concluding section, Singer notes that instruments of international law such as the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibit the use of child-combatants, but that these treaties have been ineffective in actually reducing the prevalence of child-soldiers. One hope is that the new International Criminal Court will be empowered to punish those who recruit children and send them into battle. However they seek to accomplish their goal, activists will be aided by the diligent research and reasoned analysis provided by Singer's study, as will those who fund their work&#x2014;i.e., anyone who gives to international aid organizations. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I changed my mind," explains "L," age seven, in Singer's chilling study of the now-conventional use of children in modern warfare. Some 43 percent (157 of 366) of all armed organizations around the world--from Sierra Leone to Colombia, Sri Lanka to the Congo, Liberia to Sudan--use child soldiers, 90 percent of whom see battle. In the last decade, more than 2 million children have been killed in combat, a rate of some 500 per day. Singer, National Security Fellow in the Foreign Policy Studies Program at the Brookings Institution, came upon the phenomenon when the soldiers he interviewed for his first book, <i>Corporate Warriors</i> (2003)<i>,</i> told him of seeing so many child adversaries. Here he details many of the underlying causes of the practice, and he explains how the children are recruited, often simply by whether they are strong enough to carry a weapon. He explores the full implications for using children in combat and discusses how the problem can be addressed, such as treating it as a war crime and punishing those leaders responsible. He neglects to say, though, that the abuse is first and best addressed by exposing it to world scrutiny, which this thoughtful and heartfelt book will do. <i>Alan Moores</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

More at LargePrintLiberty.com.<br><br>This book was an influential work of nonfiction on the concept of property and its relation to anarchist philosophy by the French anarchist and mutualist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, first published in 1840.<br><br>In the book, Proudhon most famously declared that "property is theft". Proudhon believed that the common conception of property conflated two distinct components which, once identified, demonstrated the difference between property used to further tyranny and property used to protect liberty. He argued that the result of an individual's labor which is currently occupied or used is a legitimate form of property. Thus, he opposed unused land being regarded as property, believing that land can only be rightfully possessed by use or occupation (which he called "possession"). As an extension of his belief that legitimate property (possession) was the result of labor and occupation, he argued against such institutions as interest on loans and rent.<br><br>Some contemporary anarchists use the terms personal property (or possessive property) and private property to signify the distinctions Proudhon put forth in regard to ownership of the produce of labor and ownership of land. In this sense, private property would refer to claimed ownership of unused land or goods, and personal property would refer to produce of labor currently in use. This differentiation is an important component in anarchist critique of capitalism.</p><p>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809 - 1865) was a French politician, founder of Mutualism, and an early anarchist. Early in his life, Proudhon worked as a printer, which gave him the opportunities of learning Latin, reading extensively, and meeting Charles Fourier and Gustave Fallot. He was later exiled from France for insulting Louis-Napolï¿½on Bonaparte.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Visual Communication: Images with Messages</h2><p>VISUAL COMMUNICATION: IMAGES WITH MESSAGES 8TH EDITION shows you how visual perception is used in all forms of communication, including typography, graphic design, data visualizations, cartoons, photography, motion pictures, television, computers, and the web.

S. Lewis) that the poet's sympathies are obviously with God and the angels loyal to him. </p><p>The achievement of Stanley Fish's <i>Surprised by Sin</i> was to reconcile the two camps by subsuming their claims in a single overarching thesis: <i>Paradise Lost</i> is a poem about how its readers came to be the way they are--that is, fallen--and the poem's lesson is proven on a reader's impulse every time he or she finds a devilish action attractive or a godly action dismaying. </p><p>Fish's argument reshaped the face of Milton studies; thirty years later the issues raised in <i>Surprised by Sin</i> continue to set the agenda and drive debate.</p></p><p>Stanley Fish is Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Humanities and Law at Florida International University. His many books include <i>There&#x2019;s No Such Thing as Free Speech: And It&#x2019;s a Good Thing, Too</i>.&#x201c;Thirty years after its original publication. <i>Surprised by Sin</i> remains the one indispensable book on Milton. This dazzling, high-stakes work of mind taught a generation of readers how to read anew. And, lest we thought its rigorous injunctions had been dulled or blandly assimilated by the intervening years, Fish dares us, in a formidable new preface, to think again.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Linda Gregerson, University of Michigan</b><br><br>&#x201c;Thirty years ago, <i>Surprised by Sin</i> initiated the modern age in Milton criticism. Still the one book necessarily engaged by Milton scholars, it continues to provoke, irritate, and illuminate. Reissued now, with a substantial new preface, it clarifies in fascinating ways not only the course of Milton studies but also the continuing career of its controversial author.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Marshall Grossman, University of Maryland at College Park</b><br><br>&#x201c;The first edition of <i>Surprised by Sin</i> revised the critical landscape of Milton studies more significantly and more influentially than any other analysis of <i>Paradise Lost</i> in modern history. The second edition contains a substantial preface, not only an apologia but also a brilliant critical manifesto in its own right. Fish thereby affirms the validity, preeminence, and timeliness of his "great argument," which will continue to inform critical debates unremittingly in the future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Albert C.

Readers who remember previous versions of these field guides from the 1970s that were dull and overly detailed will be pleasantly surprised. These books are arguably the most beautifully photographed and laid out field guides yet published for young people. Each book has an introductory section filled with interesting facts, descriptions of early naturalists, definitions of many of the terms used in the book, and a guide to using the field guide portion of the book. Best of all, the books also come equipped with laminated field "cheat sheet" cards, for quick identification while on the go, in any kind of weather. Each field guide features 50 common wildflowers with photos and brief descriptions of many more regionally occurring species. Brief discussions of threatened and endangered species are particularly valuable.

They assume some previous knowledge and background vocabulary, and are not designed to give users quick reference to found items. Instead, they introduce their respective subjects and offer tips on equipment and observation. "How to look" sections give the basic science behind the fields of study. Then come the actual guides, which contain photographs of 50 common wildflowers or rocks and other similar species or formations. Boxed inserts detail the specific information. In Wildflowers, each entry lists what to look for, leaves, height, when the flower blooms, habitat, range, and cautions (when applicable). For Rocks, the boxed inserts give the mineral composition, texture, color, and environment. Each book concludes with an illustrated glossary; Wildflowers includes pictures of the 50 state flowers. Both titles have current lists for further reading that cover a wide range of reading levels and include Web sites.

The noblest style of architecture was Gothic, but in time medieval architecture had lost the power to resist innovation. This loss of vitality was the result of the spiritual decline of Christianity during the materialistic Renaissance.

Anderson defines the complex interaction of motion pictures with the human mind and organizes the relationship between film and cognitive science. <p></p>Anderson&#x2019;s primary argument is that motion picture viewers mentally process the projected images and sounds of a movie according to the same perceptual rules used in response to visual and aural stimuli in the world outside the theater. To process everyday events in the world, the human mind is equipped with capacities developed through millions of years of evolution. In this context, Anderson builds a metatheory influenced by the writings of J. J. and Eleanor Gibson and employs it to explore motion picture comprehension as a subset of general human comprehension and perception, focusing his ecological approach to film on the analysis of cinema&#x2019;s true substance: illusion. <p></p><p>Anderson investigates how viewers, with their mental capacities designed for survival, respond to particular aspects of filmic structure&#x2015;continuity, diegesis, character development, and narrative&#x2015;and examines the ways in which rules of visual and aural processing are recognized and exploited by filmmakers. He uses Orson Welles&#x2019;s <i>Citizen Kane </i>to disassemble and redefine the contemporary concept of character identification; he addresses continuity in a shot-by-shot analysis of images from <i>Casablanca; </i>and he uses a wide range of research studies, such as Harry F. Harlow&#x2019;s work with infant rhesus monkeys, to describe how motion pictures become a substitute or surrogate reality for an audience. By examining the human capacity for play and the inherent potential for illusion, Anderson considers the reasons viewers find movies so enthralling, so emotionally powerful, and so remarkably real. </p><p></p></p><p>Anderson&#39;s primary argument is that motion picture viewers mentally process the projected images and sounds of a movie according to the same perceptual rules used in response to visual and aural stimuli in the world outside the theater.

By examining the human capacity for play and the inherent potential for illusion, Anderson considers the reasons viewers find movies so enthralling, so emotionally powerful, and so remarkably real.<p><b>Joseph D.

He didn't mind the eight-to-four shift, but unlike most of the cops he worked with, he preferred a night foot patrol. Being stuck in a car for most of the day just made him antsy. When you walked a beat, you still felt as though you had some connection to the world around you. The stars kept you company, distanced only by the haze of lights that the city cast up into the darkness. The wind knew where to find you. <br>The blue-and-white patrol car, with the gold badge of the Newford Police Department on its doors, was too confining. The squawk of the radio, trapped between metal and glass, was a constant irritation. Looking out at the street through a windshield was too much like observing the world through the glass screen of a television set. <br>But he could be patient. This was his last day on traffic. Two days off, and he'd be back to hoofing it once more: evening shift, walking a one-armed post along Grasso Street. But before that he had to go up to the reserve to see his father. <br>Big Dan Morningstar was the elected chief of the Kickaha Reserve. He considered Thomas, his eldest son, to be his only failure. <br>"You want to be a cop, why don't you join the Tribal Police?" he demanded at least once on every visit Thomas made. "But no. You want to pretend to be a white man. You want to marry a white girl. You're ashamed of your people and that brings me shame. Why can't you be more like your brother?" <br>John was unemployed and still lived with their parents, but that was never brought up, because his politics were correct. Still, he, at least, understood Thomas's position. <br>Thomas wasn't ashamed of his heritage; he just didn't want to live on the reserve. That was the reason he had entered law enforcement, but not simply to escape. He truly believed that the only hope for his people to find a prosperous future was for them to meet white society on its own terms, to have a say in the making and keeping of its laws, while still maintaining links with their own traditions. And was it his fault that the woman who stole his heart was white? Why should it make any difference what color Angie's skin was so long as they loved each other? <br>He would sit on the porch of his parents' house with those thoughts in mind, but he no longer voiced them. He would keep his face stoic as he listened to his father, and he wouldn't argue. He'd long since given up trying to change his father's mind. <br>His mother had never expressed her feelings on the subject, but she didn't need to. Thomas could always sense her unspoken approval. It was to see her and John that he tried to come by at least a couple of times a month. Angie never drove up with him. <br>He thought of Angie now as he headed north on Williamson, where it cut through the Tombs, and was only half paying attention to the driver in the vehicle ahead of him. The radio squawked, and the dispatch receiver informed all units of a possible domestic over in the Rosses. Thomas was close enough to catch the squeal and reached for the microphone, but another unit beat him to it. <br>Just as well. He hated catching a domestic. You never knew what you were going to walk into--a normal argument that had escalated a little too loudly and caused the neighbors some concern, or some wacko standing there in the hallway, waiting for you with a sawed-off shotgun. <br>As Thomas straightened in his seat, some sixth sense made him pay closer attention to the occupant of the car in front of his own. The man kept glancing back at him in his rearview mirror, then quickly shifting his gaze to the road ahead. He seemed jumpy, more high-strung than was normal, even taking into consideration the nervousness that all citizens seemed to feel in the proximity of a police officer--whether they were guilty of something or not. <br>Thomas made a mental note of the license plate number and started to apply his brakes as the lights at MacNeil up ahead turned amber. In the car ahead of him, the man's gaze met Thomas's in the rearview mirror, holding it for a beat. Panic flickered in the man's eyes and he suddenly stepped on the gas. <br>His car shot across the intersection and just narrowly missed being struck by an eager motorist jumping the light. With a squeal of tires, he sped off. Thomas hit his lights and siren. He waited long seconds for the cars on MacNeil to let him through, then set off in pursuit. Steering with one hand, he hooked free the microphone and called in to his dispatch receiver. <br>"This is Charlie-car; in pursuit of a brown, late-model Buick heading north on Williamson through the Tombs." He gave the license plate number and the few meager details of description he had of the driver. <br>"Copy, Charlie-car," the dispatcher replied. "Do you require assistance?" <br>"Wouldn't hurt. I've got a bad feeling about this." <br>"Backup's on the way. Ten-four." <br>Thomas dropped the microphone. Letting it dangle loosely from its cord, he concentrated on the pursuit. He'd seen the Buick make a sharp right two blocks north of MacNeil as he was signing off, but when he made the turn himself, the car was no longer in sight. <br>Siren blaring, he gunned the engine and raced up the deserted street. <br>This part of the city was nightmare country. The Tombs stretched for what seemed like endless blocks of derelict buildings, rubble-strewn lots, abandoned cars, and refuse. It was home to junkies and biker gangs, homeless squatters and runaways. Citizens' groups had been screaming for years to get the city to clean it up, to no avail. <br>Thomas slowed down at each cross street he came to, looking sharply left and right, but the Buick seemed to have vanished into the jungle. He killed his siren, but left the cherry lights strobing as he continued on. He could hear the approach of the backup patrol cars, wailing in the distance. From the broken windows of the abandoned buildings on either side of the street, faces peered down at him as he passed. Street rats, in uniforms of ragged jeans and T-shirts, lounged in doorways, their studied nonchalance ready to be replaced by flight should his attention turn to them. <br>He reached for the dangling mike to call in his position, then realized he didn't know where he was. Street signs here had long since been torn down or vandalized beyond recognition. All he knew was that he was somewhere in the Tombs and he'd lost the car he'd been pursuing. He brought his hand back to the steering wheel and started to brake for the next cross street. <br>A flicker of sun on metal caught the corner of his eye, and he found himself hauling on the steering wheel and squealing around the corner before he was consciously aware of making the decision to do so. The patrol car shot down the side street, slaloming around the hulk of an abandoned station wagon, orange with rust, and the rotting mass of a box spring that someone had left in the middle of the road. <br>When Thomas reached the next cross street, he was in time to see the Buick slide around another corner. He'd closed the gap between his own vehicle and the Buick by almost three car lengths, he estimated as he leaned against the driver's door to make his turn. He burned rubber up the length of the block, his own tires squealing and sliding as he followed the Buick's lead. <br>He pumped the brakes as he came around the corner. The patrol car slid sideways across the buckling pavement before it came to a jerking stop that threw Thomas against his seat belt. Halfway up the block, the Buick had crashed into the back of a derelict pickup truck. The driver of the car was on foot, running across the debris-covered lot that lay between the two old tenements fronting the scene of the accident. <br>Thomas snapped free his seat belt and rolled his car down toward the lot. He was out of the car almost before it came to a full stop. <br>"Police!" he called after the driver. <br>The driver was almost at the far side of the lot. He was overweight, definitely out of shape. Thomas didn't think he'd have any trouble running the man down. But when the driver turned at the sound of Thomas's voice, he had a gun in his hand. <br>Thomas ducked, scrabbling for his own service revolver, as the first shot rang out. The No Parking sign above his head, with its spray-painted graffiti, rang with the impact of the bullet and showered him with rust. The sound of the shot boomed and echoed between the buildings. <br>Thomas's heartbeat kicked into overdrive and his training cut in. He could almost hear his instructor's voice at the police academy ringing in his ears: "Don't aim; point like you're using your finger." <br>The revolver bucked in his hand and he saw his assailant drop. A heap of rubble hid the man from his sight. <br>Was he dead, or just wounded? <br>Thomas moved cautiously forward, giving himself plenty of cover, but it wasn't necessary. By the time he reached the downed man, he could see that the driver wasn't going to be leading any car chases ever again. He was sprawled on his stomach, the back of his head a bloodied mess. It looked as though he'd fallen backward against a low wall, but then pitched forward. His gun lay by his hand, where he had dropped it. Thomas's bullet had caught him in the face and taken off most of the back of his head on its way out. <br>Thomas moved forward, the adrenaline rush still whining through him. He kicked the man's gun a little farther from his hand--procedure, though it seemed stupid. This guy wasn't going to be reaching for anything. <br>Thomas stared at the body, his gaze caught and trapped by the gory exit wound in the back of the driver's head. Slowly it sunk in. He'd just killed a man. <br>This wasn't the body of some victim he'd come across in the line of duty, when he would seal off the immediate area so that the suits and Crime Scene Unit could conduct their investigation. The man was dead because he'd shot him. <i>He'd</i> pulled the trigger. And all the poor fuck had been doing was speeding.&#x2026; <br>He turned away and heaved up the fast-food lunch he'd eaten a couple of hours ago.

Having fallen into disrepair it has been accurately and painstakingly recreated over a period of sixteen years to embody Gertrude Jekyll&#39;s original vision. It now contains the only fully restored Jekyll wild garden still in existence. The recreation was made possible by the discovery of Jekyll&#39;s original plans at the Reef Point Collection in the United States, secured for posterity by the great American landscape architect Beatrix Farrand. Rosamund Wallinger, the current owner of the Manor House, personally undertook the restoration of this Edwardian masterpiece.

While researching the history of the house, built by Charles Holme, a leading Arts and Crafts figure of his day, she made the exciting discovery that the overgrown garden was designed by Gertrude Jekyll. Wallinger had very little interest in gardening before she moved to Upton Grey, but she had the sense to recognize Jekyll's importance, and she was determined to restore the garden to its original design. Tracking down Jekyll's original plans, which were housed at the University of California at Berkeley, she began the long and arduous task of deciphering the plans, locating plants (many of which were extremely hard to find), and tackling the physical demands of restoring the garden. She documented her progress with photographs (the before and after shots are remarkable) and a journal. Her account of the mistakes she made along the way as well as exciting discoveries and her increasing appreciation of Jekyll's legacy make fascinating reading. Sixteen years later, Upton Grey stands as the only fully restored Jekyll garden. This beautiful book will inspire any gardener and is essential for all gardening collections.DPhillip Oliver, Univ. of North Alabama Lib., Florence <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The One Minute Father</h2><p><p>The One Minute Father is the seminal One Minute book.

Kepler, a Protestant, was persecuted during the counter-Reformation, lost a wife and several children to disease, saw his mother tried as a witch, and had constant financial difficulties, yet persevered in his quest for mathematical truths. In this detailed biography, both his academic work and his personal travails are carefully documented. Period portraits and images reproduced in full color and black and white as well as diagrams and maps enhance the presentation and help to hold readers' interest. Those not fully versed in the fundamentals of physics and mathematics will still be able to grasp the material presented. Boerst's theory that Kepler was looking for harmony in the universe as an antidote to the religious disharmony of his time is apocryphal but interesting. With a time line and bibliography consisting of both primary and secondary sources, this is a worthwhile source for information on both the life and works of this Renaissance genius.<br><i>Eva Elisabeth VonAncken, Trinity-Pawling School, Pawling, NY</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6-9. Similar in format and approach to Boerst's <i>Tycho Brahe: Mapping the Heavens</i> (2003), also from the Renaissance Scientists series, this biography looks at the life, times, and accomplishments of German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630). Kepler, using Copernicus' heliocentric model and Brahe's data, made an enormous number of mathematical calculations and took some imaginative leaps to come up with his laws of planetary motion. Boerst not only offers a good portrait of the astronomer and his work but also shows the effects of the contentious political and religious forces that created upheaval in his society and made scholarship anything but a safe haven. The well-designed pages feature excellent color illustrations, such as maps, diagrams, and many period paintings and prints.

In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived. Ishmael Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve in Sierra Leone, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he&#39;d been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found he was capable of truly terrible acts. This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty.

It wasn&#x2019;t until refugees started passing through our town that we began to see that it was actually taking place in our country. Families who had walked hundreds of miles told how relatives had been killed and their houses burned. Some people felt sorry for them and offered them places to stay, but most of the refugees refused, because they said the war would eventually reach our town. The children of these families wouldn&#x2019;t look at us, and they jumped at the sound of chopping wood or as stones landed on the tin roofs flung by children hunting birds with slingshots. The adults among these children from the war zones would be lost in their thoughts during conversations with the elders of my town. Apart from their fatigue and malnourishment, it was evident they had seen something that plagued their minds, something that we would refuse to accept if they told us all of it. At times I thought that some of the stories the passersby told were exaggerated. The only wars I knew of were those that I had read about in books or seen in movies such as Rambo: First Blood, and the one in neighboring Liberia that I had heard about on the BBC news. My imagination at ten years old didn&#x2019;t have the capacity to grasp what had taken away the happiness of the refugees.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The first time that I was touched by war I was twelve. It was in January of 1993. I left home with Junior, my older brother, and our friend Talloi, both a year older than I, to go to the town of Mattru Jong, to participate in our friends&#x2019; talent show. Mohamed, my best friend, couldn&#x2019;t come because he and his father were renovating their thatched-roof kitchen that day. The four of us had started a rap and dance group when I was eight. We were first introduced to rap music during one of our visits to Mobimbi, a quarter where the foreigners who worked for the same American company as my father lived. We often went to Mobimbi to swim in a pool and watch the huge color television and the white people who crowded the visitors&#x2019; recreational area. One evening a music video that consisted of a bunch of young black fellows talking really fast came on the television. The four of us sat there mesmerized by the song, trying to understand what the black fellows were saying. At the end of the video, some letters came up at the bottom of the screen. They read &#x201c;Sugarhill Gang, &#x2018;Rapper&#x2019;s Delight.&#x2019;&#x201d; Junior quickly wrote it down on a piece of paper. After that, we came to the quarters every other weekend to study that kind of music on television. We didn&#x2019;t know what it was called then, but I was impressed with the fact that the black fellows knew how to speak English really fast, and to the beat. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, when Junior went to secondary school, he befriended some boys who taught him more about foreign music and dance. During holidays, he brought me cassettes and taught my friends and me how to dance to what we came to know as hip-hop. I loved the dance, and particularly enjoyed learning the lyrics, because they were poetic and it improved my vocabulary. One afternoon, Father came home while Junior, Mohamed, Talloi, and I were learning the verse of &#x201c;I Know You Got Soul&#x201d; by Eric B. &amp; Rakim. He stood by the door of our clay brick and tin roof house laughing and then asked, &#x201c;Can you even understand what you are saying?&#x201d; He left before Junior could answer. He sat in a hammock under the shade of the mango, guava, and orange trees and tuned his radio to the BBC news.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Now, this is good English, the kind that you should be listening to,&#x201d; he shouted from the yard.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Father listened to the news, Junior taught us how to move our feet to the beat. We alternately moved our right and then our left feet to the front and back, and simultaneously did the same with our arms, shaking our upper bodies and heads. &#x201c;This move is called the running man,&#x201d; Junior said. Afterward, we would practice miming the rap songs we had memorized. Before we parted to carry out our various evening chores of fetching water and cleaning lamps, we would say &#x201c;Peace, son&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m out,&#x201d; phrases we had picked up from the rap lyrics. Outside, the evening music of birds and crickets would commence.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On the morning that we left for Mattru Jong, we loaded our backpacks with notebooks of lyrics we were working on and stuffed our pockets with cassettes of rap albums. In those days we wore baggy jeans, and underneath them we had soccer shorts and sweatpants for dancing. Under our long-sleeved shirts we had sleeveless undershirts, T-shirts, and soccer jerseys. We wore three pairs of socks that we pulled down and folded to make our crapes* look puffy. When it got too hot in the day, we took some of the clothes off and carried them on our shoulders. They were fashionable, and we had no idea that this unusual way of dressing was going to benefit us. Since we intended to return the next day, we didn&#x2019;t say goodbye or tell anyone where we were going. We didn&#x2019;t know that we were leaving home, never to return.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To save money, we decided to walk the sixteen miles to Mattru Jong. It was a beautiful summer day, the sun wasn&#x2019;t too hot, and the walk didn&#x2019;t feel long either, as we chatted about all kinds of things, mocked and chased each other. We carried slingshots that we used to stone birds and chase the monkeys that tried to cross the main dirt road. We stopped at several rivers to swim. At one river that had a bridge across it, we heard a passenger vehicle in the distance and decided to get out of the water and see if we could catch a free ride. I got out before Junior and Talloi, and ran across the bridge with their clothes. They thought they could catch up with me before the vehicle reached the bridge, but upon realizing that it was impossible, they started running back to the river, and just when they were in the middle of the bridge, the vehicle caught up to them. The girls in the truck laughed and the driver tapped his horn. It was funny, and for the rest of the trip they tried to get me back for what I had done, but they failed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived at Kabati, my grandmother&#x2019;s village, around two in the afternoon. Mamie Kpana was the name that my grandmother was known by. She was tall and her perfectly long face complemented her beautiful cheekbones and big brown eyes. She always stood with her hands either on her hips or on her head. By looking at her, I could see where my mother had gotten her beautiful dark skin, extremely white teeth, and the translucent creases on her neck. My grandfather or kamor&#x2014;teacher, as everyone called him&#x2014;was a well-known local Arabic scholar and healer in the village and beyond.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Kabati, we ate, rested a bit, and started the last six miles. Grandmother wanted us to spend the night, but we told her that we would be back the following day.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How is that father of yours treating you these days?&#x201d; she asked in a sweet voice that was laden with worry.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why are you going to Mattru Jong, if not for school? And why do you look so skinny?&#x201d; she continued asking, but we evaded her questions. She followed us to the edge of the village and watched as we descended the hill, switching her walking stick to her left hand so that she could wave us off with her right hand, a sign of good luck.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We arrived in Mattru Jong a couple of hours later and met up with old friends, Gibrilla, Kaloko, and Khalilou. That night we went out to Bo Road, where street vendors sold food late into the night. We bought boiled groundnut and ate it as we conversed about what we were going to do the next day, made plans to see the space for the talent show and practice. We stayed in the verandah room of Khalilou&#x2019;s house. The room was small and had a tiny bed, so the four of us (Gibrilla and Kaloko went back to their houses) slept in the same bed, lying across with our feet hanging. I was able to fold my feet in a little more since I was shorter and smaller than all the other boys.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day Junior, Talloi, and I stayed at Khalilou&#x2019;s house and waited for our friends to return from school at around 2:00 p.m. But they came home early. I was cleaning my crapes and counting for Junior and Talloi, who were having a push-up competition. Gibrilla and Kaloko walked onto the verandah and joined the competition. Talloi, breathing hard and speaking slowly, asked why they were back. Gibrilla explained that the teachers had told them that the rebels had attacked Mogbwemo, our home. School had been canceled until further notice. We stopped what we were doing.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the teachers, the rebels had attacked the mining areas in the afternoon. The sudden outburst of gunfire had caused people to run for their lives in different directions. Fathers had come running from their workplaces, only to stand in front of their empty houses with no indication of where their families had gone. Mothers wept as they ran toward schools, rivers, and water taps to look for their children. Children ran home to look for parents who were wandering the streets in search of them.

Unfortunately, excitement seems to happen around her. <p>Her friend and neighbor, artist Nick Gresham, returns from a trip only to find several of his paintings slashed, reportedly by rival local artist Geoffrey Clarke. When Nick goes to have it out with him, with Eleanor in tow, they find Clarke&#x2019;s body in his studio, fatally stabbed in the back. Accused of the crime, Nick ends up in jail, while Detective Inspector Scumble and DSMegan Pencarrow, Eleanor&#x2019;s niece, investigate.

Born and raised in England, she now lives in Eugene, Oregon.Fans of Simon Brett&#39;s Fethering mysteries, in which a woman retired from a position of influence seeks a simple life in a picturesque village but keeps finding dead bodies instead, should like the second in Dunn&#39;s Cornish mystery series (the first was Manna from Hades, 2009). Eleanor Trewynn has spent years all over the globe, helping the poor through an organization called the London Committee to Save the Starving. Widowed and ready to roost back home, she settles into a fictional village in Cornwall. This time out, murder enters her life yet again when a young artist, neighbor, and friend, Nick Gresham, returns from a trip to discover that his studio has been broken into, sculptures broken, and paintings slashed. Gresham is convinced a jealous local artist destroyed his work. He rushes to the artist&#39;s studio only to find him stabbed in the back. Suspicion falls on Gresham, and, predictably, Eleanor works with the local police and her detective-sergeant niece to clear him. Worn plot lines and a bit fey in the writing, but wonderful Cornish and cozy atmosphere carry the day. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>New Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant, rev</h2><p>For almost 30 years, Moosewood Restaurant in Ithaca, New York, has been at the epicenter of America&#39;s evolving vegetarian cuisine. These 200 classic dishes are as sophisticated and eclectic as the first time the innovative cooks of the Moosewood Collective served them. Bon App?ï¿½tit named Moosewood Restaurant one of the 13 most revolutionary restaurants since the beginning of the 20th century. From soups and sandwiches to main dishes, this spirited collection of creative and accessible recipes will liven up your table.</p><p>MOOSEWOOD RESTAURANT -- named one of the 13 most revolutionary restaurants in the 20th century --has been operating in upstate New York since 1973. The first edition of NEW RECIPES FROM MOOSEWOOD RESTAURANT by the Collective sold over 240,000 copies.Ten years ago, Mollie Katzen's Moosewood Cookbook popularized the meatless fare of the Ithaca restaurant, and this latest effort proves that the Moosewood Collective still has its finger on the pulse of superior, innovative vegetarian cuisine. A new sophistication is evident: Katzen's hand lettering, a much-imitated cookbook motif, is replaced by more practical, conventional type, and dishes like chilled buttermilk and berry soups are surpassed by chilled cantaloupe-amaretto and avocado-grapefruit offerings. Inspired by ethnic and international traditions, and enhanced by fresh, seasonal ingredients, the delicious recipes feature fish with Cantonese black-bean sauce, Japanese braised eggplant, West African groundnut stew, Russian vegetable strudel, Tuscan potato salad and apricot baklava. Directions are lucid and straightforward, and even the more complicated dishes are accessible to novices. A detailed appendix defines ingredients, equipment and techniques, but preparation times are omitted from this Moosewood version. Illustrations not seen by PW.

Lee, and his intimate relationship with his commander gives Taylor&#39;s writings signal importance in any study of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. More than anyone in the Confederate Armies, Taylor knew the effective strength of Lee&#39;s forces in all engagements. He wrote dispatches for Lee and often carried messages in person to corps and division commanders. He greeted all persons who came to see Lee, and usually decided whether they would be announced to the General. When the Confederate army was disbanded, all staff officers bade farewell to Lee except Taylor, who rode back with him to Richmond, and Taylor devoted a considerable portion of his postwar years to settling controversies relative to the Army of Northern Virginia. Rarely are his conclusions disputed, because he possessed a memory known to be coherent and accurate. He became in effect &#34;&#34;an unofficial court of last resort&#34;&#34; in the arguments that abounded in the half-century after Appomattox.

Blonde Carla from South Dakota is a jazz singer who has been around the block. Almost suddenly, she finds herself fighting to hold on to Maxwell, a black tenor saxophonist from Texas. Their red-hot and sublimely tender five-year union is under siege. Those black people who oppose such relatonships in the interest of romantic entitlement or group solidarity are pressuring Maxwell, and he is wavering. As Carla battles to save the deepest love of her life, her past plays out against the present, vividly bringing forth a startlingly fresh range of characters in scenes that are as accurately drawn as they are unpredictable and innovatively conceived.</p><p>Stanley Crouch is one of the great provocateurs in American letters, which has led <i>Salon</i> to call him "the bull in the black-intelligentsia China shop." Infamous for his controversial views on race, he loves to treat iconic figures such as Toni Morrison and Spike Lee as critical pincushions. However, he has built his career primarily as a reviewer and essayist. <i>Don't the Moon Look Lonesome</i>, then, represents his first attempt at fiction.<p> Crouch's novel tells the story of a mixed-race couple, both musicians, living in New York City. Maxwell is a black sax player; Carla is a white jazz singer. Their love for each other seems to transcend race--yet the great American dilemma keeps interfering, and as they try to gain acceptance from friends and family, jazz is the one thing that soothes them. In a typical altercation, a black man in a parking lot derides Carla as a "stringy-haired white girl." But as she listens to Maxwell perform immediately afterward, the very notes he plays seem like the best possible rebuttal, "more masculine and more tender and more androgynous and more than male or female or happy or sad or frightened or brave or knowing or befuddled than anything she had ever heard her man play."</p><p> <i>Don't the Moon Look Lonesome</i> is an awkwardly written novel, and a slow-moving one at that. Long passages are devoted to descriptions of the music Carla and Maxwell create, and while Crouch has inherited Albert Murray's mantle as one of our most lively jazz critics, his own voice merges with those of his characters in an odd and distracting way. They end up sharing both the author's appetite for provocation and his wordiness, which undermines the greatest mystery of music in the first place--its wordlessness. Crouch also has a propensity for bizarre metaphors attributed to inner states, a prime example being this thorny item: "the sudden spread of this interior cactus." Finally, female readers should be warned: one of Carla's major strengths is that despite her white skin, she has a black ass. Perhaps that's progress. And perhaps Crouch's editors were so intimidated by his reputation that they neglected to tell him when he was playing out of tune. <i>--Emily White</i></p>"<b>Don't the Moon Look Lonesome</b> is a fresh vision, one that dares to take risks in the name of truth: a novel that brims over with engaging characters and observations of contemporary American life that are so insightful they break the spell of racial ideologies and agitprop fiction that have for too long distorted our understanding of what black (and American) literature can be. It is a novel that we need as we enter the twenty-first century, a stern and rich and correcting vision that will help us, one and all, to create a more humane America." <br>-- Charles Johnson<br><br>"[This is] the American novel, the novel we've been hoping would be written about what happened to all of us and our country since the 1960s. Stanley Crouch, the most savvy chronicler of the American soul in all our hues, knows, like Balzac, Faulkner, and Ellison, that the vitality of the novel means putting the real 'stuff' in it. . . . He is absolutely brilliant in his knowledge of how men and women talk, think, touch, and feel each other." <br>-- Barbara Probst Solomon<br><br>"A bold epic by a man who still feels, cares, thinks, and believes. Who better than Stanley Crouch in this country at this time to lay out the feast of American passion and paradox?" <br>-- Bharati Mukherjee<br><br>"In matters of race, few Americans feel that they can say exactly what they think. What one feels in reading <b>Don't the Moon Look Lonesome</b> is an immediate relief from the burden of ideology, from 'more of the same.' For Stanley Crouch, the facts are color free." <br>-- Saul Bellow</p><h2>Gringo Nightmare: A Young American Framed for Murder in Nicaragua</h2><p><p><i>In the spirit of </i>Midnight Express<i> and </i>Not Without My Daughter<i> comes the harrowing true story of an American held in a Nicaraguan prison for a murder he didn&#x2019;t commit.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eric Volz was in his late twenties in 2005 when he moved from California to Nicaragua.&nbsp; He and a friend cofounded a bilingual magazine, <i>El Puente,</i> and it proved more successful than they ever expected. Then Volz met Doris Jimï¿½nez, an incomparable beauty from a small Nicaraguan beach town, and they began a passionate and meaningful relationship. Though the relationship ended amicably less than a year later and Volz moved his business to the capital city of Managua, a close bond between the two endured.</p><p>Nothing prepared him for the phone call he received on November 21, 2006, when he learned that Doris had been found dead---murdered---in her seaside clothing boutique. He rushed from Managua to be with her friends and family, and before he knew it, he found himself accused of her murder, arrested, and imprisoned. </p><p>Decried in the press and vilified by his onetime friends, Volz suffered horrific conditions, illness, deadly inmates, an angry lynch mob, sadistic guards, and the merciless treatment of government officials. It was only through his dogged persistence, the tireless support of his friends and family, and the assistance of a former intelligence operative that Eric was released, in December 2007, after more than a year in prison.</p><p>A story that made national and international headlines, this is the first and only book to tell Eric&#x2019;s absorbing, moving account in his own words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Visit the companion Exhibit Hall at the Gringo Nightmare website for additional photos, audio clips, video, case files, and more.</i></p></p><p><p>ERIC VOLZ was born in Northern California.&nbsp; He is a former magazine publisher and investment consultant, who holds a degree in Latin American Studies from the University of California, San Diego.</p><p></p><p>In November 2006, while living in Nicaragua, he was falsely accused and wrongfully convicted for the rape and murder of his ex-girlfriend Doris Jimï¿½nez, and consequently sentenced to a 30-year prison term.

I could handle the hooting and the shouting, the clanging and banging against the rusted bars of the windows, but what I heard now went beyond anything I could have imagined. And through all that crazy noise, the sound of barking stood out, and I knew instantly that there were no dogs, that these were men I was hearing, men reduced to their lowest, most animal level, barking at me like wild, hungry, rabid dogs. The sound was the most evil thing I had ever heard. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is the capital of the <i>departmento</i>, or &#x201c;state,&#x201d; Rivas is a small town. The sight of a nicely dressed Anglo man (I was still wearing the suit from the funeral) being pulled out of a pickup truck in handcuffs must have been shocking to a jail that is full of thugs and borderline psychos. At the very least, I&#x2019;m sure I looked like a fresh and easy target to them. Occasional shouts of &#x201c;gringo&#x201d; would reach my ears. I could see through to one cell, where a young man had leapt up onto the bars and was hanging on and shaking them, as if he were some kind of sick monkey in a zoo. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even then, I hadn&#x2019;t been read my rights or told on what grounds I had been arrested. Inside the Rivas station, the anger and fear&nbsp; were boiling over inside me, but I forced myself to keep calm. The guard walked me to a cell&#x2014;a big holding tank, really&#x2014;in which about twenty men shuffled around. Some kept to themselves in the dark corners or stood quietly, starï¿½ing me down and sizing me up. Others were in different states of agitation, pacing or fidgeting around like men who were going mad. Even through my panic, I could tell that I wouldn&#x2019;t last long in there, but somehow I knew enough to hide my fear. I was innocent, absolutely and completely, but that didn&#x2019;t matter at that moment. In a place like this innocence is one thing, vulnerability is another. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;m not sure what made me think to get in that guard&#x2019;s face just then. Something in me I didn&#x2019;t completely recognize took over, as if all the tight situations I&#x2019;d been in had become a part of me without my realï¿½izing it. Standing in front of the door to the holding cell, I put my face an inch away from his and as coldly as I could, I said, &#x201c;If you want to sleep tonight, don&#x2019;t put me in that cell. I&#x2019;m not in the mood to be fucked with.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may have been an act, but it had the benefit of being absolutely true. Something told me that there would be trouble, and I wanted him to be thinking the same thing. For a moment, he didn&#x2019;t move. We watched each other, and I could see the wheels turning in his head. Did he really want to get up in the middle of the night, to break up a fight, or worse? Did he really want to have to report some kind of trouble to his bosses? The tension eased just a fraction. His body and his expression relaxed almost imperceptibly, but enough to let me know he was giving in. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He led me away to another cell, the only empty one. He couldn&#x2019;t budge the heavy metal door that was bent crooked, which I suppose explains why the cell looked like it hadn&#x2019;t been used in a while. The guard strained against the door, putting all his weight into it, but could not get it to open. I still can&#x2019;t believe that I did this, but I took a step forward and helped him. I gripped the bars and tugged with everything I had. It may have been my jail cell, but right then it felt like my only chance of getting through the night. Together we pulled and heaved and grunted until the cell door opened. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of sudden, I was alone in the dark and the cold. The tiny cell was bare except for a concrete slab to sleep on and a hole in the floor for a toilet. No sheets or blankets so prisoners couldn&#x2019;t hang themselves. Nothing that could be broken or held as a weapon. As the air on this frigid night moved through the decrepit jail built for tropical heat and hit my thin dress shirt, I began to shiver uncontrollably. I took off my shoes and fashioned a little pillow out of them, just something to put under my neck, and lay down. Curled up in a fetal ball, trying to wrap my arms around myself to fight off the chill, I listened to the sounds of the jail that night, the murmurs and conversations, the drug-fueled laughter and screams.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I lay there shivering, the noise of the other inmates seemed to grow louder in my ears. I tried to focus my mind on something other than the cold and the dark and the solitude and the menace on the other side of the walls. I found it almost comforting to think about some other people I had glimpsed in the cells who seemed as out of place or at least as conï¿½fused or as frightened as I felt. I remembered some young teenagers, boys really, who must have gotten way over their heads into some kind of misï¿½chief. You couldn&#x2019;t miss them, mostly because they were trying so hard to make themselves invisible. Also sitting off by herself was a grandmoï¿½therly looking woman with silver hair, who seemed to be concentrating on keeping her dignity. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 7:00 that first evening, I was taken out of the jail and walked a couple of blocks to another location in Rivas for a physical examination. The woman who checked me over was the same woman who had taken samples of my hair and cotton swabbed under my fingernails for the poï¿½lice in San Juan del Sur. Turns out she had also been at the crime scene, performing that first cursory forensic examination of Doris&#x2019;s body. She was never introduced to me in any way, and here in Rivas, it was hard to tell if she was actually a doctor or medical professional. She worked out of a simple storefront &#x201c;office&#x201d; with a plain wooden desk and chair and no sign of medical equipment. The office seemed to double as a makeshift pharmacy, with a few items&#x2014;toothpaste, combs and brushes, soap and shampoo, and such&#x2014;in a small display case. She never took any blood from me, either in San Juan or that night in Rivas, but she did examine all over visually, looking, I suppose, for fresh wounds or other signs of strugï¿½gle that might connect me directly to the murder. This examiner clearly saw the bruises left on my shoulder from carrying Doris&#x2019;s coffin but never asked me about it. In fact, I didn&#x2019;t even know they were there. It wasn&#x2019;t until later I learned that she wrote down in her report that &#x201c;the injuries were similar to those produced by fingernails, with two or three days of evolution.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I knew it, I was sitting in my cell again but still couldn&#x2019;t fully grasp what was happening to me. At that moment, it was inconceivable to me that the terrible mistake of my arrest wouldn&#x2019;t get cleared up in a matï¿½ter of days, if not hours. I expected that at any minute, someone would walk in and tell me to gather my things and get ready to go. It actually occurred to me that if the real killers were found, the cops would probï¿½ably bring them to the same jail, and I&#x2019;d have a chance to see them face-to-face. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one point in the middle of that first night, the guard who had promï¿½ised he wouldn&#x2019;t put anyone in the cell with me brought in a frightened kid who had gotten into a fight in town, and later two more street thugs were thrown in as well. Even as I kept myself half hidden in the corner shadows of the cell and adopted the body language of someone hard and dangerous, I stared at those guys, steaming with the thought that one or all of them might have killed Doris. I remember looking across into the crowded comï¿½mon cells on that next morning, trying to see if anyone gave me a sense that they might be the one. There was one guy about my age, dressed and groomed nicely enough that he seemed out of place with all the hoods in the common cells, who caught my attention. He kept looking at me like he knew something I didn&#x2019;t. In my mind, hyper with exhaustion, he started to look like the type of dude that Doris might have gotten mixed up with. Of course, I had no clue who or what she might have been mixed up with, and that guy in cell across from me turned out to have nothing whatsoever to do with the case. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frigid, dark, and covered in filth, the Rivas jail felt like the underï¿½world. You&#x2019;d be amazed at the kinds of things you can get used to. The first night sleeping on a slab of cold concrete, I would either feel shooting pain through my hips and shoulders and limbs or complete numbness in these parts from the pressure on a particular nerve. Quickly, though, I started to figure out the little tricks&#x2014; the right way to wrap my shirt or jacket into a pillow and place under one of my joints or how to position my shoes just so under my neck to make the long nights somehow bearï¿½able. I even started to get used to the disgusting stench from the vomit and feces smeared around the holes in the cement floor we were expected to use as toilets. Many came in drunk and spent their first couple of hours detoxing over the toilet hole. The men themselves all stank, especially if they had been there a while, with the stale, rank odor of sweat and dirt and suffering. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guards would bring around a pot of rice and beans twice a day, but you were on your own as far as a plate was concerned. From the first day, I had to figure out how to scramble just to get a few bites of food. Like every prison, there&#x2019;s a pecking order among the inmates, and there&#x2019;s always someone who seems to have access to something the others need. The Rivas police jail only houses transients&#x2014;people awaiting processing or trial for petty crimes or convicted murderers and rapists on their way into the penitentiary system&#x2014; but even there, you needed to know which guys could get you a plate or something&nbsp; else you needed in exchange for some other favor. Right from the beginning, a prisoner has to negotiate for the most basic things. I felt immediately like that put me at a disadvantage, but strangely that kind of survival mentality forces the inmates to depend on, even while abusing, one another. I was getting just a tiny glimpse of what it was going to mean to be part of <i>el sistema</i>, &#x201c;the prison system.&#x201d; <br></p><p>Excerpted from Gringo Nightmare by Eric Volz.<br>Copyright 2010 by Eric Volz.<br>Published in April 2010 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press.<br>All rights reserved.

Let me ask you this question: How many of you reading here have heard my album of gospel songs? Now don't you be shy, speak right up, right out loud. Anybody looks at you funny, you just tell them you're talking to a book. I promise you, they won't bother you again. </p><p> Just be grateful that all I asked you to do was say a few words out loud. Usually when I address people I begin by asking them to smile. I love to see people smiling. Love it. A smile is the mirror to the soul. It's a reflection of the character that's inside you. It reflects exactly how you feel about yourself. It tells the world, I'm happy! So go ahead and smile. I mean, you paid for all that dental work, you might just as well show it. When you buy a big expensive car you don't keep it locked in the garage. With all the money you've spent at the dentists don't keep those teeth locked in your mouth! That's right, show off that big Buick grill of a mouth! </p><p> And then I usually ask people to turn to the side and look at the person right next to them directly in the eyes. And shake their hand. Get to know them. Then after you get to know them, if they're nice enough give them a hug. Just go ahead and hug on 'em. And then I ask them to kiss -- wait, don't you go doing that. You'd definitely have a tough time convincing a judge that you kissed a stranger because a book told you to. </p><p> Obviously there is a big difference between reading a book and listening to me speak in person, but some things are exactly the same. Let me tell you, when I ask an audience how many people have heard my gospel album those people usually give me exactly the same answer I get when I ask that question to people reading my book; total silence. My friends, if you really want to hear my album you just go on into your local record store and look for it; though you might want to look in the section labeled "landfill." When an album is successful it goes "gold," my album went "lead." That didn't bother me, I knew I wasn't really a singer. What I was, was the quarterback of the Super Bowl champions. That's a well-known rule; you win a Super Bowl you get to record an album. </p><p> Not really a singer is only one of the many things I am not. Besides married, I mean. I am definitely not married. I am also not a movie actor, a television show host, or a talk-radio host, although I've also tried to do those things. Unsuccessfully. And those aren't the only things I've failed at, those are just some of the highlights. I've failed at a great variety of jobs. If there is one subject at which I am very good, it's failure. If failing was considered a profession, I'd be a legend at it. </p><p> But I got to record several albums, host my own TV show, appear in movies, host a talk-radio show, and make numerous commercials because I was very good at handing off a football to another man or passing it to a receiver and letting him run with it. Let him get hit by the big guys. That was my primary experience, handing off a football or passing it. So when record producers heard my voice they probably said, "Maybe he don't sound that great, but he won a Super Bowl." Or when television producers saw me acting they might have decided, "That boy sure doesn't look that good, but he won a Super Bowl!" </p><p> Can I have an amen on winning the Super Bowl, please? </p><p> You win just one Super Bowl and people'll amen you to death. </p><p> Lemme have an amen on amening! Hallelujah to that, Brother Terry! </p><p> There was one other thing I could do. I could talk. I mean, I could definitely talk. I could fill a silence better than jelly filled a doughnut, better than a cow filled a milk pitcher, better than Pamela Anderson filled -- well, you get the concept. So I began making speeches. I spoke anyplace they would have me. I spoke in auditoriums, I spoke in gymnasiums, I spoke standing up in the back of a '52 pick-up truck. And I became very successful. In fact, by the time I realized I had nothing of true importance to say it was too late, I was already a big success at making speeches. </p><p> One reason I have been successful at it is because I begin almost every speech by making a promise that I know I can fulfill. And I hereby make that same promise to you right on this very page: By the time you finish this book you will feel better about yourself. Because after you read my words you will know for certain that you are more intelligent than at least one person in the world. </p><p> Here's a little hint; most times when somebody tells you they are not very smart they are trying to outsmart you: "Ah, shucks, ya'all, I'm too dang dumb to know that this here marshmallow roaster is worth a lot more than the $99 in three easy installments I'm selling it to you for." </p><p> I am not trying to outsmart you. Not me. Not with my family background. When I got my job at the Fox network, for example, my Momma was just thrilled. "Baby, that's wonderful," she said. When I asked her why, she told me, "'Cause it's much easier to spell than ESPN." </p><p> Throughout my entire professional football career I was known for being dumb. That was my professional image. Dick Butkus was ferocious. Walter Payton was as elusive as mercury. Terry Bradshaw was dumb. D-u-m. Dumb. Bradshaw was so dumb he couldn't pass a physical. In the off-season Bradshaw works as a test dummy. And truthfully it hurt me when people said that. It was said about me that I couldn't spell "cat" even if they spotted me the <i>c</i> and the <i>t.</i> Other people laughed. But it was not something I thought was funny or clever. It was not an image I embraced. I wasn't even smart enough to realize how beneficial that image might be to me later in my life. Being dumb became my character. </p><p> You ever see me doing a commercial? I'm the one fishing in the swimming pool. I'm the one driving two ways on a one-way street. I'm the one getting insulted by a puppet. </p><p> It is a character that has worked very well for me. For example, when I make speeches to large groups -- not like right now when I'm addressing you personally -- I explain that I'm not really as dumb as my image. I have a PE degree from Louisiana Tech, I say proudly. I have a PE degree! Some people laugh when I say that, but there's nothing at all funny about a PE degree. When I earned that degree my family was mighty proud of me. Not counting my older brother, I was the very first person in our family to graduate from college. Although admittedly my grandfather, my pawpaw, didn't quite understand my degree. "A Pee degree?" he kept asking. "Heck, when I was coming up they didn't have to teach it, they just sent you out back behind the house and told you not to do it upwind." </p><p> Truth is, though, all along I was smart enough to understand that I wasn't really that smart. That was an important piece of information. At times I've struggled with life the way an ant struggles with a suitcase. I have a perfect record in marriage, for example: three marriages, three divorces, a perfect record. I've made and lost and made and lost a considerable amount of money. I've done so many things in my life that even I don't understand -- buying two ostrich eggs for $7,000 would be a particularly fine example of that -- that I no longer worry about it. </p><p> But for a long time I did want to understand my life. Part of my problems, I discovered as an adult, came from the fact that I had ADD, attention deficit disorder. That made it hard for me to focus on things I didn't really like. School, for instance. It also made it difficult for me to retain information. I'd read a question on a test, I'd know the answer, but before I could write it down I'd not only forget the answer, I'd forget the question. I didn't do well on tests. The problem with that is when you're young and people tell you that you're not ve</p></p><h2>Handcrafting Bamboo Fly Rods</h2><p>The bamboo fly rod represents the pinnacle of the fly-fishing art: its apparent simplicity and delicacy belie the craftsmanship and strength that are the hallmarks of all great rods. <p>Wayne Cattanach begins in the Kwangsi and Kwantung provinces of China, where Tonkin bamboo takes about eight years to develop the qualities that distinguish it from all other materials: a tensile strength akin to steel, light in weight, with the flexibility that gives all bamboo rods their relaxed action. </p><p>He describes the process that will take anyone from lengths of hard, raw bamboo to a beautiful finished rod with clear, step-by-step instructions, including how to: find the best supplies; select tools and materials; make and use heat treaters and binders; select rod taper, weight, and action; cut culms; straighten bamboo strips; primary and secondary planing; stagger bamboo strips; give proper heat treating; bind strips; apply finish; mount the reel seat, ferrules, and tip top; and much more. </p><p>Scores of illustrations and line drawings demonstrate crucial techniques that before this book could only be guessed at, and Wayne's years of experience with pupils and bamboo are brought to bear at every step as his invaluable tips not only instruct, but also explain how to avoid common beginners' mistakes.

Luckily she was welcomed as a guest into See Skwat.<br><br>New York City in the &#x2018;90s saw the streets of the Lower East Side overun with derelict buildings, junkies huddled in dark corners, and dealers packing guns. People in desperate need of housing, worn down from waiting for years in line on the low-income housing lists, had been moving in and fixing up city-abandoned buildings since the mid-80s in the LES.<br><br>Squatters took over entire buildings, but these structures were barely habitable. They were overrun with vermin, lacking plumbing, electricity, and even walls, floors, and a roof. Punks and outcasts joined the squatter movement and tackled an epic rebuilding project to create homes for themselves.<br><br>The squatters were forced to be secretive and exclusive as a result of their poor legal standing in the buildings. Few outsiders were welcome and fewer photographers or journalists. Thayer&#x2019;s camera accompanied her everywhere as she lived at the squats and worked alongside other residents. Ash observed them training each other in these necessary crafts and finding much of their materials in the overflowing bounty that is New York City&#x2019;s refuse and trash. The trust earned from her subjects was unique and her access intimate. Kill City&nbsp; is a true untold story of New York&#x2019;s legendary LES squatters.</p><p><b>ASH THAYER</b>&nbsp;is a photographer and multimedia visual artist based in Los Angeles.

Mother, Come Home is Hornschemeier&#39;s graphic novel debut-the quietly stunning tale of a father and son struggling, by varying degrees of escapism and fantasy, to come to terms with the death of the family&#39;s mother. The story seamlessly weaves through the surreal and the painfully factual, guided by the careful, somber colors and inventive pacing unique to Hornschmeier&#39;s storytelling. Mother, Come Home extracts almost tangible drama from the most tranquil of moments, making that which is unspoken in each panel easily audible, and almost uncomfortably experienced.</p><p>Paul Hornschemeier lives in Chicago, IL, with his fiancï¿½e, Emily. He is the author of several graphic novels, including Mother, Come Home, Let Us Be Perfectly Clear, The Three Paradoxes, All and Sundry and Forlorn Funnies.Adult/High School&#x2013;Collecting two issues of Hornschemeier's "Forlorn Funnies" series, <i>Mother, Come Home</i> is a stand-alone retrospective tale of family tragedy told by Thomas Tennant, who lost his mother to cancer when he was seven. The story opens after her death, with his professor father struggling to maintain some sense of comfort and equilibrium for himself and his son. Thomas, occasionally donning a superhero cape and lion mask, fights to keep things together by cleaning up after his father, lying to the college when his dad misses yet another class, and tending his mother's garden. Needing more help than his son can provide, the father checks himself into residential care. Forced to move in with an uncle and aunt, Thomas copes by entering a bright, cartoonish fantasy world where everything is how he wants it. His fantasies drive the heart-wrenching climax when he "rescues" his father from the care center. The simplified forms and muted earth tones of the artwork alongside dark and serious themes create links to Chris Ware's <i>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</i> (Pantheon, 2000), but Hornschemeier wields that rare gift of layered subtlety. Be it an almost imperceptible change in facial expressions or the slow death of a flower, he says significant, moving things in a few panels that would take pages to convey in a novel. But the book's greatest strength is the story itself and the lessons it offers for life, loss, and, most importantly, how to move on.<i>&#x2013;Matthew L.

As decapitated heads and dismembered body parts surfaced in the Seine, Commissaire Georges-Victor Massu, head of the Brigade Criminelle, was tasked with tracking down the elusive murderer in a twilight world of Gestapo, gangsters, resistance fighters, pimps, prostitutes, spies, and other shadowy figures of the Parisian underworld.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The main suspect was Dr. Marcel Petiot, a handsome, charming physician with remarkable charisma.&nbsp; He was the &#x201c;People&#x2019;s Doctor,&#x201d; known for his many acts of kindness and generosity, not least in providing free medical care for the poor.&nbsp; Petiot, however, would soon be charged with twenty-seven murders, though authorities suspected the total was considerably higher, perhaps even as many as 150.<br><br>Who was being slaughtered, and why?&nbsp; Was Petiot a sexual sadist, as the press suggested, killing for thrills?&nbsp; Was he allied with the Gestapo, or, on the contrary, the French Resistance?&nbsp; Or did he work for no one other than himself?&nbsp; Trying to solve the many mysteries of the case, Massu would unravel a plot of unspeakable deviousness.&nbsp; <br>When Petiot was finally arrested, the French police hoped for answers.&nbsp;<br><br>But the trial soon became a circus.&nbsp; Attempting to try all twenty-seven cases at once, the prosecution stumbled in its marathon cross-examinations, and Petiot, enjoying the spotlight, responded with astonishing ease.&nbsp; His attorney, Renï¿½ Floriot, a rising star in the world of criminal defense, also effectively, if aggressively, countered the charges.&nbsp; Soon, despite a team of prosecuting attorneys, dozens of witnesses, and over one ton of evidence, Petiot&#x2019;s brilliance and wit threatened to win the day.<br><br>Drawing extensively on many new sources, including the massive, classified French police file on Dr. Petiot, <i>Death in the City of Light</i> is a brilliant evocation of Nazi-Occupied Paris and a harrowing exploration of murder, betrayal, and evil of staggering proportions.</p><p>DAVID KING is the author of the acclaimed <i>Vienna, 1814</i> and <i>Finding Atlantis</i>.

It should be idyllic, culminating in a reception at the beautiful Maine farm owned by Sarah's aunt Julia Clancy. But not even her own impending nuptials can keep Sarah from probing a local mystery.<br>This time the troubles strike literally close to home. Aunt Julia receives a series of sinister nursery rhymes telling her to leave High Hope Farm, and then the disquieting incidents begin: A groom falls through the hayloft; the farmhouse is splattered by buckshot; two stable helpers vanish into thin air; and a psychic librarian goes about the neighborhood proclaiming ruin and blood on the new moon.<br>The reception does go forward as planned, but the happy event is marred by the morning-after discovery of a corpse in the stable. Sarah and Alex are brought home from their honeymoon as witnesses: They just may have seen the killer dance at their wedding. Obviously, the newlyweds have no time to settle into married life. Murder comes first, and they must try to solve the crimes before a horse show offers the perfect opportunity to destroy High Hope Farm for good.</p><p>Along with her horse, Conky Noodle, J.S. BORTHWICK lives on the Maine coast, where most of her books are set.In their sixth engaging and literate adventure, following Dude on Arrival , Sarah Deane, English teacher and Ph.D. candidate at Maine's Bowmouth College, and her fiance, physician Alex McKenzie, are distracted from wedding plans when Sarah's widowed Aunt Julia begins receiving threatening notes. Crusty, independent Julia, owner of High Hope Farm, is initially untroubled by the hand-delivered nursery rhymes rewritten with unnerving twists, e.g., "Julia Clancy sat on a wall / Julia Clancy had a great fall." The list of possible culprits includes neighbor Colonel Harvey Dodge, a persistent suitor who thinks he and Julia should marry, blending their farms and their lives; librarian Tilly Martin, who says that she has learned from the stars and runes that each person in the area should take over a neighbor's property; a mining company that has shown a recent interest in local mineral rights. The threats continue, leading finally, during Sarah and Alex's reception at Julia's beloved horse farm, to a suspicious death. In this character-oriented mystery, Borthwick makes the suspects, Julia's neighbors and the mining company seem largely, though not entirely, innocent, giving Sarah and Alex a challenging puzzle to solve--as though pulling off a wedding were a piece of cake. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>THE OCTOBER COUNTRY 40th Anniversary Edition (SIGNED by Ray Bradbury)</h2><p>hardcover in slipcase limited to 500 copies</p><p></p><h2>Great Book Of Sports Cars</h2><p>Descriptions and photos of over 200 of the world&#39;s greatest automobiles by the auto editors of Consumer Guide.</p><p></p><h2>Flour and Stone: Baked for Love, Life and Happiness: Baked for Love, Life and Happiness</h2><p><b>A luscious celebration of baking for life, love, and happiness&#x2014;written by a master baker.</b><br><br>Flour and Stone is a petite bakery in Sydney, Australia with a large and loyal following due to its scrumptious treats including panna cotta lamingtons, flaky croissants, chewy cookies, dreamy cakes, and delectable pastries of every kind.<br> <br>Nadine Ingram and her dedicated team bake with finesse and love to bring pleasure to their customers.

On stage from a very young age, June found her niche in the spotlight with her vivacious personality and down-home sense of humor. Her confidence and spirit were what attracted Johnny Cash to her in the late 1950s. On the road together, they quickly bonded. June was his helpmate and closest companion. They were married for forty years, through addiction and success, tragedy and triumph.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>Anchored in Love</em> is an inside look into the life of June Carter Cash, through the eyes of her only child with Johnny Cash-John Carter Cash. With skillful prose, he reveals new information about the legendary woman through his tender memories and heartwarming stories.</p></p><p><strong>John Carter Cash</strong> is a five-time Grammy-winning record producer, and author of numerous articles published in popular newspapers and magazines. He owns and manages Cash Cabin Studio. John Carter diligently preserves the family legacy and is caretaker to the heritage of his muscial ancestors. He is the only child of June Carter and Johnny Cash. He lives with his wife, Laura, and three children, Joseph, Anna Maybelle, and Jack Ezra, in Hendersonville, Tennessee.The only son of country legends Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash pens a heartfelt narrative of his mother's life that nicely combines biography, autobiography and inspirational guidebook into a fitting tribute to a woman whose life and career embodied modern country music. Musician and producer Cash spends the first half of his book reviewing his mom's early days performing with the legendary Carter Family in 1939, and her later marriage to Johnny Cash. This story has been notably told before in June's two autobiographies and Mark Zwonitzer's definitive <i>Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone?</i>, which Cash dutifully cites, while adding some fascinating stories, such as a possible more-than-flirtation with the young Elvis Presley and various aspects of Johnny and June's courtship that he feels the film <i>Walk the Line</i> lacked. But the book really begins to soar in its second half. Cash unflinchingly details the addictions that beset himself and many of his sisters&#x2014;as well as June and Johnny's addictions late in their lives&#x2014;while lovingly showing how throughout this time, and until her death in 2003, June's unshakable religious faith infused her life and helped inspire her children to continue the legacy of her family's music and its strong work ethic. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the beginning of the book the chapters &#34;Origin and Revelation of the Church&#34; and &#34;Definition and Characteristics of the Church&#34; emphasise that the Church is not a human organisation but a Divine-Human Organism. It is the Body of Christ and a &#34;communion of deification&#34;. The source of the Church is God Himself. The characteristics of the Church (One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic) are analysed, as well as the aim of the Church, which is man&#39;s deification and salvation. An explanation is given of who the real members of the Church are. In the chapter on &#34;Orthodoxy according to the Holy Fathers&#34; it is made clear that Orthodoxy is the true faith and the real Church, because only within the Church is the salvation of man made sure. The unity between the Church, Orthodoxy and the divine Eucharist is underlined, since the holy Fathers stress that Orthodoxy is the true faith of the Church and the divine Eucharist is the true action of the Church. The chapter entitled &#34;The Church and the Divine Eucharist according to St Maximos the Confessor&#34; looks in detail at the teaching of St Maximos the Confessor on the Church and the Divine Eucharist in a work of his called &#34;Mystagogy&#34;. The divine Eucharist points to the whole work of the divine Economy and signifies the soul&#39;s journey to acquiring true knowledge. Within the Holy Temple (the Church building) and the divine Eucharist Christians have the living experience of the unity of the Church.</p><p></p><h2>Disney&#39;s The Little Mermaid: Look and Find</h2><p>Large Hardcover Edition, LOOK AND FIND ARIEL AND FRIENDS!!

He has also won four Shamus Awards, and was the first recipient of the Nero Wolfe Award. He is the author of over 40 books, many of which feature the characters Bernie Rhodenbarr, Matthew Scudder, Chip Harrison, and Evan Tanner. He lives in New York City with his wife Lynne.In this third installment of Block's popular series, Chip Harrison is settling in as assistant to detective Leo Haig. Cases are scarce for the pair because Leo will accept only those befitting a would-be world-renowned sleuth. An unfortunate turn of events gives them just such a scenario when Chip discovers the still-warm body of his girlfriend, Melanie Trelawney. The New York police are only too willing to accept overdose as the cause of death, but Chip and Leo are suspicious, especially considering the previous "accidental" deaths of two of Melanie's four sisters. Determined to protect the remaining Trelawney siblings, Chip and Leo work to unravel the machinations of a savvy and sinister killer. Gregory Gorton's narration takes some getting used to due to the pitch of his voice and the cadence of his reading, which make Chip, the book's narrator, sound more high-strung than is warranted. Gorton shines as the short, round, and eccentric Leo, using thoughtful deliberation to portray his unique blend of humility, pomposity, and intelligence. Although Gorton could have given greater attention and color to the secondary characters, his reading does justice to this cleverly plotted story.

But what if your &#x201c;efficient&#x201d; company&#x2014;the one with the reduced headcount and the &#x201c;stretch&#x201d; goals&#x2014;is actually slowing down and losing money? What if your employees are burning out doing the work of two or more people, leaving them no time for planning, prioritizing, or even lunch? What if you&#x2019;re losing employees faster than you can hire them? What if your superefficient company is suddenly falling behind?<br><br>Tom DeMarco, a leading management consultant to both Fortune 500 and up-and-coming companies, has discovered a counterintuitive principle that explains why efficiency improvement can sometimes make a company <i>slow</i>. If your real organizational goal is to become fast (responsive and agile), then he proposes that what you need is not more efficiency, but more slack. <br><br>What is &#x201c;slack&#x201d;? Slack is the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change. It could be something as simple as adding an assistant to a department, letting high-priced talent spend less time at the photo copier and more time making key decisions. Slack could also appear in the way a company treats employees: instead of loading them up with overwork, a company designed with slack allows its people room to breathe, increase effectiveness, and reinvent themselves.<br><br>In thirty&#x2014;three short chapters filled with creative learning tools and charts, you and your company can learn how to:<br><br>&#x2211;make sense of the Efficiency/Flexibility quandary<br><br>&#x2211;run directly toward risk instead of away from it<br><br>&#x2211;strengthen the creative role of middle management<br><br>&#x2211;make change and growth work together for even greater profits<br><br>A innovative approach that works for new- and old-economy companies alike, this revolutionary handbook will debunk commonly held assumptions about real-world management, and give you and your company a brand-new model for achieving and maintaining true effectiveness&#x2014;and a healthier bottom line.</p><p>Another entry in the small but growing management library that suggests purposely slowing down and smelling the roses could actually boost productivity in today's 24/7 world, Tom DeMarco's <i>Slack</i> stands out because it is aimed at "the infernal busyness of the modern workplace." DeMarco writes, "Organizations sometimes become obsessed with efficiency and make themselves so busy that responsiveness and net effectiveness suffer." By intentionally creating downtime, or "slack," management will find a much-needed opportunity to build a "capacity to change" into an otherwise strained enterprise that will help companies respond more successfully to constantly evolving conditions. Focusing specifically on knowledge workers and the environment in which they toil, DeMarco addresses the corporate stress that results from going full-tilt, and offers remedies he thinks will foster growth instead of stagnation. Slack, he contends, is just the thing to nurture the out-of-box thinking required in the 21st century, and within these pages, he makes a strong case for it. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>"An irreverent counterpoint to treatises about corporate efficiency. Brisk, compelling, and hard to put down." &#x2013;<i>Financial Executive<br></i><br>"Tom DeMarco goes after one of the most pervasive and pernicious myths of business--that humans are efficient the same way machines are. <i>Slack</i> will change the way you manage and understand your business." &#x2013;David Weinberger, author of <i>The Cluetrain Manifesto</i><br><br>"In times of many layoffs, shrinking staffs, vanishing 'think time,' middle managerial heads rolling, and mounting pressure to produce more faster . . . there are few limits on who can get some thoughts from [<i>Slack</i>].&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>CNN.com</i></p><h2>Benny and Penny in Lights Out: Toon Books Level 2</h2><p>It&#x2019;s nearly time for lights out but Benny and Penny just can&#x2019;t settle down.

In 2009, Benny and Penny in the Big No-No! received the Theodor Seuss Geisel Award given by the American Library Association for "the most distinguished American book for beginning readers published in English."K-Gr 2-These mice siblings have very different approaches to bedtime. While Penny is following her mother's directions, brushing her teeth and settling into bed to read a story, Benny is too busy for such routines. When he looks out the window and cannot see the moon, he decides that pirates must have stolen it. After attempting to scare Penny with tales of the Boogey Mouse and dinosaurs, he decides that he might just go to bed after all. He realizes, however, that he has left his beloved pirate hat in the spooky playhouse, and he enlists Penny to help him retrieve it. Containing all of the classic problems that children sharing a bedroom face, this charming graphic novel is certain to delight Benny and Penny fans and find some new ones as well. Hayes's signature illustrations evoke dusk and evening time with the outdoor panels employing blues, purples, and grays while the indoor panels shine with bright yellow as if from a night-light. The mixture of sequential art and full-page panels adds to the movement of the story and will help early readers get a sense of its pacing.

She grew up in Los Angeles as a fully bicultural, bilingual American. She studied psychology at UCLA and marriage and family therapy at Santa Clara University. Deeply concerned with the lack of Spanish speakers in her profession, Cecilia has practiced within the Latino communities in some of the most impoverished inner-city areas of San Jose and Los Angeles. She lives with her British-born husband in San Gabriel, California.<b> Chapter One </b> <p> </p><p> </p><p> What I love most is the warmth, how it reaches in and spreads out to the tips of my fingers and toes until it feels like I'm part of the sun, like it's growing inside me. Have you ever seen the ocean turn smooth as a sheet of glass or curl upon the shore with a sigh? If you knew my country then you'd know that the sea can be many things; faithful and blue as the sky one moment and the next a shimmering turquoise so brilliant, you'd swear the sun was shinning from beneath the waves. </p><p> I often stand at the water's edge, digging my toes into the moist sand and gaze out at the ghostly gray line of the horizon that separates sea and sky. I close my eyes just a little so I can no longer be sure which is which, and I'm floating in a blue green universe. I'm a fish and then a bird. I'm a golden mermaid with long flowing hair that gets lost in the wind. With a flick of my tail I can return to the sea and explore the shores of other lands, but how can I leave this place that quiets my soul to a prayer? </p><p> Better to stay and lay on a blanket of fine white sand, gazing up at the royal palms for hours as we do. They sway in the ocean breeze, and I almost fall asleep if not for the constant chatter of my cousin, Alicia. She's hardly a year older than me, in fact for thirteen days out of the year we're exactly the same age, but for some reason she seems older and wiser. Perhaps it's because she's so sure of what she likes. She has no doubt that she prefers mango ice cream to coconut and that her favorite number is nine because nine is the age we were then and if nine were a person it would be a glamorous lady, a showgirl with long legs and swinging hips. I, on the other hand, have a hard time choosing between mango and coconut and if you throw in papaya, I'm completely overwhelmed. </p><p> Alicia squints up at the sun with eyes that are sometimes gold, sometimes green, and tells me what she sees. "Look how the palms move in the wind." </p><p> "I see them," I respond. </p><p> "They're sweeping the clouds away with their big leaves so we can look straight up to heaven and see God." </p><p> "Can you see God?" I ask. </p><p> "If I look at it just right, I can. And when I do, I ask Him for whatever I want and He'll give it to me." </p><p> I turn away from the swaying palms to study Alicia's face. Sometimes she likes to joke around and doesn't tell me the truth until she's certain she's tricked me. But I know her dimples show when she's hiding a smile. They're almost showing now. </p><p> "Tell the truth," I prod. </p><p> "I am." Then she opens her eyes as wide as she can and stares straight up at the sun and shuts them tight until tiny tears slip down her cheeks. She turns to face me, eyes sparkling and lips curled in a triumphant smile. "I just saw Him." </p><p> "What did you ask for?" </p><p> "I can't tell you or else He won't give it to me." </p><p> I too turn my face toward the sun and try to open my eyes as wide as Alicia, but I can't keep them open for even half a second, and I certainly don't see God or even the wisp of an angel's wing. I conclude that brown eyes are not as receptive to heavenly wonders as her magnificent golden eyes. </p><p> Alicia sits up suddenly and looks down at me, blocking the sun. "What did you ask for?" </p><p> "I thought you said we couldn't tell." I object, not wanting to admit I'd failed to see anything at all. </p><p> She settles back down onto the sand, while a full sun stretches over us once again. Soon we'll have to head back for our afternoon meal. These morning hours at the beach slip away so fast. </p><p> I was hoping we'd get a chance to go swimming, but we aren't allowed in past our knees without a trusted adult nearby to keep watch. Ever since a little boy drowned at Varadero beach three years ago that's been the rule, and there's no use trying to change it. </p><p> "I want to go swimming," I say. </p><p> Alicia turns to survey the ocean. We see the waves lapping the white curve of the beach and know the sea is a warm bath. We'd float easily in the calm waters and maybe even learn how to swim more like the grown-ups, moving our arms like steady and reliable windmills. And maybe our grandfather, Abuelo Antonio, undoubtedly the best swimmer in all of Cuba, will come out with us and we'll take turns venturing into deeper water while riding safely on his shoulders. </p><p> "Let's go!" Alicia cries and we spring to our feet and run as fast as we can, leaving a wake of powdery white sand floating behind us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> All of the rooms in my grandparents' large house at Varadero overlooked the sea, and the dinning room was no exception. Abuela kept the windows open most of the time as she believed fresh air to be the best defense against the many diseases she worried about. Lace curtains fluttered on the incoming ocean breeze as Abuelo said the blessing over our meal. It wasn't until he lifted his head and took up his fork that we were allowed to do the same. </p><p> I was lucky to be sitting closest to the fried bananas, my favorite, and to have Alicia right next to me. At home, our parents knew better and always separated us so we wouldn't talk and giggle when we should be learning proper table manners. It seemed that Mami was more concerned with what fork I used for the salad than with my school work. </p><p> Most of the time, Abuelo and Abuela were amused by our antics and laughed at what our parents called foolishness. </p><p> "Look at how dark you're getting," Abuela said as she handed me a large bowl of fluffy yellow rice. "People will think you're a mulatica and not the white, full-blooded Spaniard that you are." Being a full-blooded Spaniard was also a very important thing, even more important than proper manners. </p><p> I helped myself to a generous serving of rice. "Look at Alicia. She's almost as dark as me," I shot back. </p><p> "Alicia's a Spaniard through and through," Abuela said. "With those light eyes and hair, there's no mistaking her heritage. She can get as black as a ripened date, and she'll still look like a Spaniard." </p><p> At these moments, the only thing that kept me from envying Alicia for her superior coloring, was that she always came to my rescue. "I think Nora looks beautiful, like a tropical princess," she said. </p><p> "That's right, Abuela. I look like a tropical princess." </p><p> Abuelo laughed. Having been born in Spain, he was more Spanish than anyone, but he didn't care as much as Abuela about where people came from or who their parents were. And even though he never bragged, everyone knew he was a real Spaniard because of his accent and eloquent speech, so different from the brusque Cuban style. "Would the princess mind passing the <i>plï¿½tanos</i> before she eats them all herself?" he asked with a slight bow of his head. </p><p> Later that afternoon, after we'd had our mandatory naps, Abuelo was easily persuaded to go out to the beach and continue his swimming lessons. I promised Papi I'd learn to be a good swimmer during this week's vacation, but I hadn't progressed nearly enough to impress him. </p><p> "Too much time playing around and not enough time practicing," Abuelo declared as he stood with us on the shore wearing dark blue swim trunks and a white <i>guayabera</i> shirt, perfectly pressed by Abuela that morning and every morning. </p><p> Alicia and I stood on either side of him, each clasping onto one of his big hands as we gazed out at the peaceful sea. Together, we stepped into the water and felt the waves caress our feet. We ventured in further and the silky blanket swirled up to our knees and then up to our waists, but we could easily see our toes wiggling in the sand. </p><p> We stood silent and nervous, waiting for Abuelo's instructions to begin. Perhaps he'd have us float on our backs as he usually did. Maybe we'd practice kicking our feet with our heads under water while he taxied us around by our hands that grasped at him for dear life when he dared to let go. Or he'd dive into deeper water while we clung to his neck, laughing and sputtering when he came up for air. "Not so deep, Abuelo!" we'd cry, hoping he'd go a little deeper still. </p><p> Instead, he pointed to the platform that floated a hundred yards from the shore. "You see that out there?" </p><p> We were quite familiar with the platform. This was the famous place to which both of our fathers had to swim as children in order to be declared real swimmers and allowed into the ocean without adult supervision. We'd heard the stories a million times and when our parents dropped us off we bragged that by the end of the week we would've conquered the platform. </p><p> On most days older kids were on and around it, diving into the water, lifting themselves easily on to the wooden planks, and jumping off again like loud happy seals, but on this afternoon the platform bobbed about without a soul upon it. In fact, except for a couple very far off holding hands, the beach was empty. Everyone still seemed to be resting after lunch. </p><p> "Well, do you see it?" Abuelo asked again, still pointing. </p><p> I felt the butterflies begin to stir. "Yes, I see it." </p><p> I detected a slight tremor in Alicia's voice as well. </p><p> He squeezed our hands. "Today you're going to swim out there all by yourselves. Who wants to go first?" </p><p> Neither of us spoke. "What? Nobody wants to go first?" Abuelo smiled down at us and then with an exaggerated expression of concern and surprise said, "You're not afraid, are you?" </p><p> "I think I'm a little bit afraid," I said. </p><p> Alicia thrust out her chin. "I'm not. I'll go first." </p><p> "That's my girl!" Abuelo dropped my hand and held Alicia's up in the air as if she'd won a prizefight. </p><p> "Now follow me and try to move your arms like this when you kick." Abuelo circled his arms over his head and Alicia imitated him as best she could while I stood with my arms glued to my side, aware that this lesson wasn't meant for me. Abuelo pulled his guayabera up over his head and threw it onto the sand before diving smoothly into the sea with hardly a splash. Three or four strokes of his powerful arms and in no time at all he was pulling himself up on to the platform and waving for Alicia to follow. </p><p> She began with more of a ...</p></p><h2>How to Pray After You&#39;ve Kicked the Dog</h2><p>When it comes to prayer, we second guess God.

She was a reformer of the Carmelite Order and is considered to be a founder of the Discalced Carmelites, along with John of the Cross. Her books, which include her autobiography (The Life of Teresa of Jesus) and her seminal work The Interior Castle, are an integral part of Spanish Renaissance literature, as well as Christian mysticism and Christian meditation practices.</p><h2>The Two Towers (The Lord of the Rings, Part 2)</h2><p>Frodo must carry the One Ring through the ghostly borders of Mordor, Land of the Enemy, and back to the Fire that can destroy its evil powers, in the second volume in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Heroes from stories aren&#x2019;t real anyway, and that&#x2019;s what the past is, right? A story told by whoever had the biggest gun. Instead, we&#x2019;re supposed to find heroes around us.<br> <br>I have nowhere to look, though, because my body <i>won&#x2019;t</i> look. It&#x2019;s made of ashes and wind and dead things, nothing but an echo of a heartbeat left inside me. My life has turned into a dream, every moment I&#x2019;m Asleep making it harder to remember what it was like to be awake. If there was a hero next to me I wouldn&#x2019;t know, because all I can see is the dark side of my eyelids, feel the grainy sheet on the bed underneath me. The only things that change are sounds. Temperature. Right now I&#x2019;m cold. I can hear the steady <i>plink, plink, plink</i> of fluid dripping to my IV.<br> <br>The door hinge squeaks, and cool air washes over me from the hallway like a breeze from the ocean, vast as a year and deep as the sky. If my body could tense, it would, but instead I&#x2019;m curled up inside my mind, waiting for whoever it is to poke or prod me. To pick up my dead weight and throw me in a burn pile, mutter ugly things into my dead ears, or touch my dead body because I can&#x2019;t stop them. Whoever it is stays quiet, lurking near my bed.<br> <br><i>You are alive, not dead.</i> It&#x2019;s a whisper at the back of my mind, crumpled like a wet sheet of paper. <i>Just like the princess in our story. Asleep until someone kisses you awake.</i><br> <br>I wish I could grimace, because that&#x2019;s not the only ending I&#x2019;ve heard to the sleeping princess&#x2019;s story. Also, I don&#x2019;t want anyone in Dr. Yang&#x2019;s base to kiss me, thank you very much.<br> <br>The person prowling in my room sits in what I think must be a chair, the legs squeaking under their weight. I hear quick, nervous breaths that are free of a gas mask&#x2019;s rusty tang. The bit of me that&#x2019;s still awake braces for violence or worse. No mask means SS now, and SS is a beast that I don&#x2019;t have the muscles to fight anymore.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve done everything you asked.&#x201d; A muffled voice filters through the closed door. <i>Helix</i>, my brain supplies. <i>The Menghu who killed June&#x2019;s father</i>. The person invading my room bolts up from the chair, footsteps padding to the far side of my bed away from the door. &#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t enough Mantis to last us much longer.&#x201d; Helix&#x2019;s voice grows louder, though it&#x2019;s still attempting a respectful tone. &#x201c;You <i>promised</i>&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t argue with me, Captain Lan.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s Dr. Yang. The door opens again, his footsteps tapping in, probably here for my weekly checkup. I think it&#x2019;s weekly. Maybe it&#x2019;s daily, and I&#x2019;ve only been lying here for two days. I can&#x2019;t tell.<br> <br>He pauses inside the room. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to be sending orders to Dazhai?&#x201d; Not speaking to me, because he knows I cannot answer.<br> <br>The intruder by my bed doesn&#x2019;t move for a good thirty seconds. But then the sound of army boots on concrete rings out as they leave my side and walk out the door.<br> <br>Eight years my mother survived this. Eight years she <i>listened</i>, keeping her mind awake so she&#x2019;d be able to pass on the possibility of curing SS. I&#x2019;m like her, I guess. Dr. Yang put me to Sleep for knowing the truth too. That the note Mother left me in the device we found at Dazhai wasn&#x2019;t gibberish. It was a clue telling me where to find the cure.<br> <br>&#x201c;Medicine is an exact science.&#x201d; The doctor is speaking again, vague amusement at my unauthorized visitor melting away to leave only clinical precision. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to trust me, Helix. I promised you a cure, but you and your soldiers will have to be patient.&#x201d;<br> <br>He can&#x2019;t get the cure. Not unless I tell him where Mother hid it. The tiny living part inside me raises her head, listening to Helix&#x2019;s silence. It&#x2019;s heavy. A waiting silence that could end in death or destruction or maybe a cup of tea. It&#x2019;s hard to tell. All I know is Helix doesn&#x2019;t ask any more questions.<br></p><h2>ZooZical</h2><p>Winter weather is keeping children from visiting the zoo. So the animals are out of sorts&#x2014;listless, grumpy, and no longer fun. All except two little friends, a very small hippo and a baby kangaroo. Their hip-hopping, toe-tapping,&nbsp; and rap-rocking soon has the other animals joining in the hip-aroo beat. "Racoons danced in pairs, baboons danced in troops, and snakes joined the dancers as live hula-hoops." Children's favorite songs get a funny new spin&#x2014;seals bark out "The seals on the bus go round and round"&#x2014;as the animals create their very own musical.<br><br>Young readers and listeners will be amazed and delighted at how the animals chase the winter doldrums by getting along as friends, pooling their talents, and pushing themselves to new heights. After all, these are the same clever animals who learned to read in Judy Sierra's and Marc Brown's <i>Wild About Books</i>, an award-winning <i>New York Times</i> #1 bestselling picture book. <i>ZooZical</i> is sure to inspire some "can do" fun in kindergarten and primary grades.</p><p><b>A Letter from Author Judy Sierra</b> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> I think of my new book, <i>ZooZical</i>, as a little kids&#x2019; Broadway musical. The idea came to me a few years ago, after my picture book <i>The Sleepy Little Alphabet</i> was published. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to read it aloud to the kindergarten classes at the school where my husband was principal. When the children saw the final illustration--twenty-six little letters asleep in twenty-six little beds--they burst out singing &#x201c;The Alphabet Song.&#x201d; What fun it would be, I thought, to write a picture book based on classic children&#x2019;s songs! I knew who the cast and crew of my musical <i>ZooZical</i> would be: the zoo animals from <i>Wild About Books</i>, illustrated by Marc Brown. <p></p> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s put on a show&#x201d; is an old and very productive story line. I could picture so many scenes of animals performing. But what would their motivation be? I looked out my office window at gray skies. It had been raining for weeks on end. Might the animals be seeking a cure for the midwinter doldrums? If terrible weather was getting them down, then kids and families were probably staying home, too, and life at the zoo would be bleak without humorous humans to watch. Putting on a show could cheer up the animals, and also bring visitors back to the zoo. <p></p> I wrote <i>ZooZical</i> in rhymed couplets and triplets, to a Seussian beat (anapestic tetrameter, mostly). I find this meter ideal for storytelling--so perfect, in fact, that it often conjures up parts of a tale as if by magic. As I brainstormed <i>ZooZical</i>, two main characters--a very small hippo and a young kangaroo--hopped into the story, unannounced, as the main characters. They are clever and creative enough to come up with the idea of putting on a musical, and talented enough to play starring roles in the production. Other animals dance and sing to silly versions of old favorites like &#x201c;Oh My Darling, Porcupine,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Seals on the Bus,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Zoo Hokey Pokey.&#x201d; Everyone discovers that music, creativity, friendship, and cooperation are tip-top antidotes for any sort of doldrums. <p></p> After many months of work and countless revisions, I emailed the <i>ZooZical</i> manuscript to my editor at Knopf, Janet Schulman, and to the marvelous Marc Brown, who gave it two thumbs and six paintbrushes up. As I write this, Marc is sketching scenes for the third picture book in this series, set at the mythical Springfield Zoo. <p></p>JUDY SIERRA is the author of many critically acclaimed children's books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Wild About Books</i>, <i>The Sleepy Little Alphabet, Born to Read, Mind Your Manners, B.B.

He grew up in Oxford, Mississippi, and left high school at fifteen to work in his grandfather&#39;s bank. Rejected by the US military in 1915, he joined the Canadian flyers with the RAF, but was still in training when the war ended. Returning home, he studied at the University of Mississippi and visited Europe briefly in 1925. His first poem was published in The New Republic in 1919. His first book of verse and early novels followed, but his major work began with the publication of The Sound and the Fury in 1929. As I Lay Dying (1930), Sanctuary (1931), Light in August (1932), Absalom, Absalom! (1936) and The Wild Palms (1939) are the key works of his great creative period leading up to Intruder in the Dust (1948). During the 1930s, he worked in Hollywood on film scripts, notably The Blue Lamp, co-written with Raymond Chandler. William Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949 and the Pulitzer Prize for The Reivers just before his death in July 1962.&#34;By universal consent of critics and common readers, Faulkner is now recognised as the strongest American novelist of the century, clearly surpassing Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald, and standing as an equal in the sequence that includes Hawthorne, Melville, Mark Twain and Henry James&#34; -- Harold Bloom &#34;There is no writer living who can play upon a scene the rich and Rembrandtesque flame that Faulkner commands&#34; * Evening Standard * &#34;His prose style is all his own, often sensuously alert, evocative, graceful&#34; * Daily Telegraph *</p><h2>Make The Music Go Bang!: The Early L.A.

Liturgical time, like all ecclesiastical structures, has interacted with other traditions since the early centuries. Yet Doctor Talley found that the gospel tradition and its liturgical employment shaped the period that comprises the liturgical year. His findings illustrate for the reader that every festival the Church celebrates?every Sunday?is centered primarily and finally in the Eucharist, which from the beginning and always proclaims the Lord&#39;s death until he comes.</p><h2>Farrow &amp; Ball: The Art of Color</h2><p><p>Farrow &amp; Ball is a leader in the luxury paint and wallpaper market, catering to top designers and discerning homeowners who seek the finest quality products to adorn their walls.

A former teacher herself, she grew up in Wales and now lives in Canada.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>Claudia Martin had already had a hard day at school.<br><br>First Mademoiselle Pierre, one of the nonresident teachers, had sent a messenger just before breakfast with the news that she was indisposed with a migraine headache and would be unable to come to school, and Claudia, as both owner and headmistress, had been obliged to conduct most of the French and music classes in addition to her own subjects. French was no great problem; music was more of a challenge. Worse, the account books, which she had intended to bring up to date during her spare classes today, remained undone, with days fast running out in which to get accomplished all the myriad tasks that needed doing.<br><br>Then just before the noonday meal, when classes were over for the morning and discipline was at its slackest, Paula Hern had decided that she objected to the way Molly Wiggins looked at her and voiced her displeasure publicly and eloquently. And since Paula's father was a successful businessman and as rich as Croesus and she put on airs accordingly while Molly was the youngest&#x2014;and most timid&#x2014;of the charity girls and did not even know who her father was, then of course Agnes Ryde had felt obliged to jump into the fray in vigorous defense of the downtrodden, her Cockney accent returning with ear-jarring clarity. Claudia had been forced to deal with the matter and extract more-or-less sincere apologies from all sides and mete out suitable punishments to all except the more-or-less innocent Molly.<br><br>Then, an hour later, just when Miss Walton had been about to step outdoors with the junior class en route to Bath Abbey, where she had intended to give an informal lesson in art and architecture, the heavens had opened in a downpour to end downpours and there had been all the fuss of finding the girls somewhere else to go within the school and something else to do. Not that that had been Claudia's problem, but she had been made annoyingly aware of the girls' loud disappointment beyond her classroom door as she struggled to teach French irregular verbs. She had finally gone out there to inform them that if they had any complaint about the untimely arrival of the rain, then they must take it up privately with God during their evening prayers, but in the meantime they would be silent until Miss Walton had closed a classroom door behind them.<br><br>Then, just after classes were finished for the afternoon and the girls had gone upstairs to comb their hair and wash their hands ready for tea, something had gone wrong with the doorknob on one of the dormitories and eight of the girls, trapped inside until Mr. Keeble, the elderly school porter, had creaked his way up there to release them before mending the knob, had screeched and giggled and rattled the door. Miss Thompson had dealt with the crisis by reading them a lecture on patience and decorum, though circumstances had forced her to speak in a voice that could be heard from within&#x2014;and therefore through much of the rest of the school too, including Claudia's office.<br><br>It had not been the best of days, as Claudia had just been remarking&#x2014;without contradiction&#x2014;to Eleanor Thompson and Lila Walton over tea in her private sitting room a short while after the prisoners had been freed. She could do with far fewer such days.<br><br>And yet now!<br><br>Now, to cap everything off and make an already trying day more so, there was a marquess awaiting her pleasure in the visitors' parlor downstairs.<br><br>A marquess, for the love of all that was wonderful!<br><br>That was what the silver-edged visiting card she held between two fingers said&#x2014;the Marquess of Attingsborough. The porter had just delivered it into her hands, looking sour and disapproving as he did so&#x2014;a not unusual expression for him, especially when any male who was not a teacher invaded his domain.<br><br>"A marquess," she said, looking up from the card to frown at her fellow teachers. "Whatever can he want? Did he say, Mr. Keeble?"<br><br>"He did not say and I did not ask, miss," the porter replied. "But if you was to ask me, he is up to no good. He smiled at me."<br><br>"Ha! A cardinal sin indeed," Claudia said dryly while Eleanor laughed.<br><br>"Perhaps," Lila suggested, "he has a daughter he wishes to place at the school."<br><br>"A marquess?" Claudia raised her eyebrows and Lila looked suitably quelled.<br><br>"Perhaps, Claudia," Eleanor said, a twinkle in her eye, "he has two daughters."<br><br>Claudia snorted and then sighed, took one more sip of her tea, and got reluctantly to her feet.<br><br>"I suppose I had better go and see what he wants," she said. "It will be more productive than sitting here guessing. But of all things to happen today of all days. A marquess."<br><br>Eleanor laughed again. "Poor man," she said. "I pity him."<br><br>Claudia had never had much use for the aristocracy&#x2014;idle, arrogant, cold-hearted, nasty lot&#x2014;though the marriage of two of her teachers and closest friends to titled gentlemen had forced her to admit during the past few years that perhaps some of them might be agreeable and even worthy individuals. But it did not amuse her to have one of their number, a stranger, intrude into her own world without a by-your-leave, especially at the end of a difficult day.<br><br>She did not believe for a single moment that this marquess wished to place any daughter of his at her school.<br><br>She preceded Mr. Keeble down the stairs since she did not wish to move at his slow pace. She ought, she supposed, to have gone into her bedchamber first to see that she was looking respectable, which she was quite possibly not doing after a hard day at school. She usually made sure that she presented a neat appearance to visitors. But she scorned to make such an effort for a marquess and risk appearing obsequious in her own eyes.<br><br>By the time she opened the door into the visitors' parlor, she was bristling with a quite unjustified indignation. How dared he come here to disturb her on her own property, whatever his business might be.<br><br>She looked down at the visiting card still in her hand.<br><br>"The Marquess of Attingsborough?" she said in a voice not unlike the one she had used on Paula Hern earlier in the day&#x2014;the one that said she was not going to be at all impressed by any pretension of grandeur.<br><br>"At your service, ma'am. Miss Martin, I presume?" He was standing across the room, close to the window. He bowed elegantly.<br><br>Claudia's indignation soared. One steady glance at him was not sufficient upon which to make any informed judgment of his character, of course, but really, if the man had any imperfection of form or feature or taste in apparel, it was by no means apparent. He was tall and broad of shoulder and chest and slim of waist and hips. His legs were long and well shaped. His hair was dark and thick and shining, his face handsome, his eyes and mouth good-humored. He was dressed with impeccable elegance but without a trace of ostentation. His Hessian boots alone were probably worth a fortune, and Claudia guessed that if she were to stand directly over them and look down, she would see her own face reflected in them&#x2014;and probably her flat, untidy hair and limp dress collar as well.<br><br>She clasped her hands at her waist lest she test her theory by touching the collar points. She held his card pinched between one thumb and forefinger.<br><br>"What may I do for you, sir?" she asked, deliberately avoiding calling him my lord&#x2014;a ridiculous affectation, in her opinion.<br><br>He smiled at her, and if perfection could be improved upon, it had just happened&#x2014;he had good teeth. Claudia steeled herself to resist the charm she was sure he possessed in aces.<br><br>"I come as a messenger, ma'am," he said, "from Lady Whitleaf."<br><br>He reached into an inner pocket of his coat and withdrew a sealed paper.<br><br>"From Susanna?" Claudia took one step farther into the room.<br><br>Susanna Osbourne had been a teacher at the school until her marriage last year to Viscount Whitleaf. Claudia had always rejoiced at Susanna's good fortune in making both an eligible marriage and a love match and yet she still mourned her own loss of a dear friend and colleague and a good teacher. She had lost three such friends&#x2014;all in the same cause&#x2014;over the course of four years. Sometimes it was hard not to be selfishly depressed by it all.<br><br>"When she knew I was coming to Bath to spend a few days with my mother and my father, who is taking the waters," the marquess said, "she asked me to call here and pay my respects to you. And she gave me this letter, perhaps to convince you that I am no impostor."<br><br>His eyes smiled again as he came across the room and placed the letter in her hand. And as if at least his eyes could not have been mud-colored or something equally nondescript, she could see that they were a clear blue, almost like a summer sky.<br><br>Susanna had asked him to come and pay his respects? Why?<br><br>"Whitleaf is the cousin of a cousin of mine," the marquess explained. "Or an almost cousin of mine, anyway. It is complicated, as family relationships often are. Lauren Butler, Viscountess Ravensberg, is a cousin by virtue of the fact that her mother married my aunt's brother-in-law. We have been close since childhood. And Whitleaf is Lauren's first cousin. And so in a sense both he and his lady have a strong familial claim on me."<br><br>If he was a marquess, Claudia thought with sudden suspicion, and his father was still alive, what did that make his father? But he was here at Susanna's behest and it behooved her to be a little better than just icily polite.<br><br>"Thank you," she said, "for coming in person to deliver the letter. I am much obliged to you, sir. May I offer you a cup of tea?" She willed him to say no.<br><br>"I will not put you to that trouble, ...</p><h2>NIV Reference Bible, Personal Size (Burgundy Leather-Look)</h2><p>Enjoy reading the Bible comfortably and with greater insight.

Nesbit</p><p>EDITH NESBIT was a mischievous child who grew up into an unconventional adult. With her husband, Hubert Bland, she was one of the founder members of the socialist Fabian Society; their household became a centre of the socialist and literary circles of the times. E. Nesbit turned late to children&#39;s writing. Her first children&#39;s book, THE TREASURE SEEKERS, was published in 1899 to great acclaim. Other books featuring the Bastable children followed, and a series of magical fantasy books, including FIVE CHILDREN AND IT also became very popular. THE RAILWAY CHILDREN was first published monthly in the LONDON MAGAZINE in 1905, and published as a book in 1906 and has been in print ever since.She&#39;s the children&#39;s writer with whom I most identify. She said, &#34;By some lucky chance, I remember exactly how I felt and thought at 11.&#34; That struck a chord with me. The Story of the Treasure Seekers was a breakthrough children&#39;s book. Oswald is such a very real narrator, at a time when most people were writing morality plays for children * J. K. Rowling * If Britain is to children&#39;s fantasy as Brazil is to football, then Edith Nesbit is our Pele - endlessly surprising and inventive. But she is more than that. There were fantasy writers before Edith Nesbit but she is the one that brought the magical and the mundane together in a moment of nuclear fusion. She opened the door in the magic wardrobe, pointed the way to platform nine and three quarters. She even had a hand in building the Tardis. And these are among her minor achievements. She is also simply the funniest writer we have ever had, while being the one who could most easily and sweetly break your heart with a phrase. Just try saying &#34;Daddy oh my Daddy&#34; without catching your breath. She made the magic worlds feel as near as the Lewisham Road and she bathed the Lewisham Road in magic -- Frank Cottrell-Boyce I loved the direct first-person narrative in the clear, forthright tones of Oswald Bastable * Jacqueline Wilson * I love E.

All the main branches of the wonderful and intricate traditional Celtic ornament are represented: spirals, geometric step and maze patterns, animal and plant patterns, and knotwork. In ancient times, several artists would work together to decorate an important book, one drawing in pen and ink, another painting in the patterns. Here the reader is invited to fulfill the role of painter, while being guided and inspired with notes on the history of the designs and on the choice and order of colors. This repertoire of Celtic designs, created by one of the leading proponents of the genre, is based on traditional sources, such as the Book of Kells and Pictish carved stonework. It is a creative and engaging introduction to Celtic art, and makes an ideal gift for anyone fascinated by the Celtic legacy. It will be of great value to artists, designers, and crafts people interested in experimenting with new patterns and techniques.</p><p></p><h2>Poems By Faiz (Oip)</h2><p>Faiz Ahmen Faiz is looked on as the most important Urdu poet in both India and Pakistan.

Priestley famously described the 'three Englands' he saw in the 1930s: Old England; nineteenth-century England and the new, post-war England. Thirties Britain was, indeed, a world of contrasts, ultimately torn between the image of a nation rendered hopeless by the Depression, unemployment and international tensions, and that of a Britain of complacent suburban home-owners with a baby Austin in every garage.Now Juliet Gardiner, acclaimed author of the award-winning 'Wartime', provides a fresh perspective on that restless, uncertain, ambitious decade, bringing the complex experience of thirties Britain alive through newspapers, magazines, memoirs, letters, diaries and interviews.Gardiner captures the essence of a people part-mesmerised by 'modernism' in architecture, art, in the proliferation of 'dream palaces', the insistence on fitness and fresh air, the obsession with speed, the growth and regimentation of leisure, the democratisation of the countryside, the celebration of elegance, glamour and sensation. Yet, at the same time, this was a nation imbued with a pervasive awareness of loss - of Britain's influence in the world, of accepted political, social and cultural signposts and finally, of peace itself.</p></p><p>Juliet Gardiner is a respected commentator on British social history from the Victorian times through to the 1950s. She was Editor of History Today magazine and is also the author of the critically acclaimed and bestselling `Wartime&#39;.`The cinematic clarity of Gardiner&#39;s descriptions of accidents and ceremonies tells more about the decade than a page of statistics....or the depth of its research, the quality of the writing and the sheer richness and vibrancy of the material, this is a quite outstanding work of social history&#39; Telegraph `It is comfortably the definitive account of a decade that has been much maligned&#39; Daily Telegraph `A definitive, vividly detailed book on a complex decade, which is a joy to read&#39; History Today</p><h2>The Forbidden City (The World of Lone Wolf, Book 2)</h2><p>Fantasy role-playing at its most exciting.

The implementation problems encountered over the next six years, the company&#39;s internal disagreements along with those it had with its rivals, and the anticipated regional economic benefits the tracks would bring comprise the concluding chapters of Slavery, Scandal, and Steel Rails. The book&#39;s beginning details how the southwestern territory those rails crossed was purchased from Mexico in 1854. James Gadsden of Charleston, South Carolina started championing a southern cross-country railroad in 1846 to improve his hometown&#39;s economy and to export slavery west of Texas. At the conclusion of the Mexican American War two years later, the United States obtained 600,000 square miles of new territory, but not enough to accommodate the southern route. That is why, at the urging of Jefferson Davis, Gadsden was appointed Minister to Mexico. Gadsden&#39;s negotiations to acquire more Mexican land were complicated by several factors, including dubious instructions from a secret messenger. He was able, however, to finalize a treaty, which was later substantially altered by the United States Senate, that resulted in the Gadsden Purchase.</p><p>Since 1995, award-winning author David Devine has written extensively on the history of southern Arizona, including about its early motels, the old warehouses near Tucson?s train station, and the incorporation battles of South Tucson.

Renamed True Son, he came to think of himself as fully Indian. But eleven years later his tribe, the Lenni Lenape, has signed a treaty with the white men and agreed to return their captives, including fifteen-year-old True Son. Now he must go back to the family he has forgotten, whose language is no longer his, and whose ways of dress and behavior are as strange to him as the ways of the forest are to them. A beautifully written, sensitively told story of a white boy brought up by Indians, The Light in the Forest is a beloved American classic."Rebellion, glowing vitality. . . .

Large numbers of the newly-designed Panther and Tiger tanks were rolling off the production lines, and Hitler was convinced that, with appropriate numbers, German armor could turn the tide against the advancing Soviets on the Eastern Front. Despite the reservations of his leading generals, Hitler was determined this offensive take place. <br><br>On the 5th July 1943, the German army launched Operation Citadel. Attacking with a force of 3000 tanks and assault guns, the Germans faced a well-dug in force of more than 3900 Soviet tanks, with another 1500 tanks in reserve. The tanks advanced with as many as 50 packed together per kilometer of line. What followed was the largest tank battle the world has ever seen, with heavy casualties on both sides in this titanic clash of arms. <br><br>On the 11th July, three SS divisions - Totenkopf, Das Reich and Liebstandarte - attempted to break through the Soviet lines at the village of Prokhorovka and so unhinge the Soviet defensive position. Facing them were newly deployed Fifth Guards Tanks Army. The battle raged all day, with German attack followed by Soviet counterattack. By nightfall the Germans had lost more than 300 tanks and the Fifth Guards Tanks Army 50 percent of their strength. Despite the heavy losses, the Soviet defenders had achieved their aim: the German attack had been halted and the initiative lost. <br><br>With firsthand accounts from both sides, vivid photographs, and specially commissioned maps of the combat zones, Kursk: The Vital 24 Hours is a comprehensive examination of the decisive failure of the German's last large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front. <br></p><p>The author: (Location: Hampshire) has worked in journalism and publishing since 1972, specialising in military history.

With every evocative verse, we visit one of fourteen different water landscapes and cultural areas around the world, each stunningly illustrated with a breathtaking view of a place of natural beauty and conveying a sense of the drama, joy, power, serenity, grandeur, or peacefulness of water. From the Grand Canal of Venice to Qutang Gorge in China, from the Sahara in Morocco to the Andes of Chile, we learn about the world through the lens of water, our most precious, life-giving resource.</p><p>Pat is the author of numerous award-winning children s books. She is also the founder of the family literacy initiative El dï¿½a de los niï¿½os/El dï¿½a de los libros (Children s Day/Book Day). Mora and her husband live in Santa Fe, New Mexico.Evocative watercolor images and graceful short poems in Spanish and English celebrate water in all its forms and around the world. What appears at first to be a simple expression of the myriad forms of water from waves to clouds, fog and frost and in lazy marshes, churning rivers, breaking waves and more becomes a trip around the world as readers come to realize that the locations and people shown are just as wide-ranging. A picture key at the end identifies the location for each illustration. The cover images, the front inspired by Victoria Falls in southern Africa and the back, a geyser in Iceland, set the stage for the variety inside. Mora's deceptively simple three-line poems are full of imagery, too. "In the murmur of marsh wind, / water slumbers on moss, / whispers soft songs far under frog feet." (In Spanish: "En el viento susurrante de los pantanos, / el agua duerme sobre el musgo, / murmura suaves canciones bajo patitas de ranas.") Watercolors are the perfect accompaniment to this pleasing collection, and So's mastery of her medium is evident in the wide range of her illustrations, some with lines and detail, others with bold brush strokes or delicate shading. She concludes with an image of our watery world and its dry moon from space, an important reminder. A lovely bilingual addition to the "sense of wonder" shelf. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>In this bilingual book, Mora uses her travels around the world to talk about water in unique ways, while creating varied and compelling imagery. In the Grand Canyon, water is described as "skidding and slipping, swooping round bends, spinning on tree roots, careening down cliffs." Younger readers will enjoy the calmness of the words, while older readers will want to imitate the author's style and try their own hand at descriptive writing. So's watercolor illustrations match the tone of the writing perfectly and capture the different landscapes and cultural nuances. Use this book to introduce the water cycle, land forms, or poetry. Pair it with Splish Splash (HMH, 1994), a poetry book by Joan Bransfield Graham. --School Library Journal<br><br>In a bilingual tribute to water with a truly global scope, Mora s (I Pledge Allegiance) verse and So s (Brush of the Gods) spare mixed-media illustrations swing from placid to tempestuous, creating an effective and fitting ebb and flow. A description of a peaceful river scene inspired by the Yangtze ( Slow into rivers/ water slithers and snakes/ through silent canyons at twilight and dawn ) contrasts with an evocation of a violent Patagonia sea ( In storms, water plunges/ in thunder s brash roar,/ races through branches from lightning s white flash ). So s palette also shifts to suit the vista: children in Finland play by a brook framed by brilliant fall foliage, while smoky grays dominate a hushed scene featuring the human and feline residents of Venice, enshrouded in fog. Some of the images and allusions suggest water s life-sustaining power: men fish in India, Kenyan women fetch water from a well, and in the canals of Holland, water streams, water slides,/ gliding up roots of tulips and corn. An expressive celebration of the world's waterscapes. --Publishers Weekly</p><h2>With All Dispatch</h2><p>Britain&#39;s esteemed writer of naval adventure returns with the 18th novel in the acclaimed Richard Bolitho series.</p><p></p><h2>The Magic Garden: Take a journey through the magical world of nature</h2><p>Just like the passing of the seasons, or the mysterious transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly, in this garden, everything is continually changing.<br><br> With gorgeous illustrations and a beautiful story of a young girl discovering the marvels of nature, <i>The Magic Garden</i> is sure to delight young readers.

In her new memoir, Suberman reveals yet another overlooked aspect of America's past--the domestic side of war.<br><br> Her story begins in the Miami Beach she grew up in, when hotel signs boasted "Always a View, Never a Jew" and where a passenger ship lingered just off shore carrying hundreds of European Jews hoping for--but never finding--sanctuary. It was a time of innocence, before that war in Europe became our war.<br><br> Stella was nineteen when America entered the fighting. By the time she was twenty-three, the war was over. She married Jack Suberman the week he enlisted and set out alone to join him in California. She was kicked off trains to make room for soldiers, her luggage was stolen, she was arrested for soliciting, but she was determined to follow her husband. And she did so for the next four years as he was sent from air base to air base, first training to be a bombardier and then training others. It wasn't until he was sent overseas to fly combat missions that she finally went back home to wait, as did so many other soldier's wives.<br><br> This remarkable memoir renders a double understanding of war--of how it matured a young woman and how it matured a country. By personalizing the patriotism of the 1940s, Stella Suberman's story becomes the story of all military wives and serves as a powerful reminder of how differently many Americans feel about war sixty years later.</p><p>Stella Suberman was born in Union City, Tennessee, the setting for her memoir, <i>The Jew Store</i>, and spent her teens in Miami Beach, Florida. After twenty years in North Carolina, she returned to Florida in 1966 as the administrative director of the Lowe Art Museum of the University of Miami. Now retired, she lives in Boca Raton.Adult/High School-Suberman's first autobiographical work, The Jew Store (Algonquin, 1999), offered readers a portrait of life in the semirural South of her childhood. The story here takes up with her coming-of-age in Florida and her home-front experiences during World War II. The author's Jewish identity didn't mean much to her when she first met her future husband, Jack Suberman, in college. Although he was not religious, he thought deeply and spoke cogently to her about the fact of their Jewishness-what it meant to their peers, what Jim Crow should mean to Jews, and how to reconsider her own prejudices. Marriage and military service happened almost simultaneously for the young couple. Stella traveled to the West to be with Jack as he trained to be a fighter pilot. They had a son. Jack, like some of their friends before him, shipped out to war. Suberman brings a strong and steady voice to this combination memory and unflinching self-analysis. Reflective teens will learn much about human nature's openness to change and moral growth, without feeling themselves confronted by anything akin to preaching. The author's excellent expository style serves as a model, too, for those wanting to create deeper nonfiction collections for high school students.<br><i>Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i><br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For more than twenty years he has studied and written about the relationship of religion, violence, and peace and his books include Jesus Against Christianity: Reclaiming the Missing Jesus and School of Assassins: Guns, Greed, and Globalization."Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer joins a distinguished company of writers who, as an act of faithfulness, are attempting to reinvent Christianity. None of them, however, makes a more trenchant case for the ways Christianity has twisted Jesus' God of Compassion into a God of Violence than Nelson-Pallmeyer. Jesus Against Christianity attempts to recover Jesus at the heart of a Christianity transformed." &#x2014; Walter Wink, author of "The Human Being: Jesus and the Enigma of the Son of the Man". (Walter Wink)<br><br>"The missing Jesus has been missing since the early followers discovered they could not weave a big and lasting movement by following him closely. Enter councils and creeds. Things to believe, memorize and recite. A passive gospel. Exit the Jesus who had neither doctrine not set goals, save a striving for justice. Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer has written a powerful and important book. Those whose playhouse is threatened will turn away. Others will exult to read what they had suspected all along but were afraid to bring into sharp focus." &#x2014; Will Campbell, author of Brother to a Dragonfly (Will Campbell)<br><br>"In a world where many people are now asking, "What would Jesus do?", we need a book like Jesus Against Christianity. Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer boldly suggests that the Jesus who confronted the religious institutions of his time also challenges present day Christianity. If we are persuaded by the argument this book sets forth, we will discover that doing what Jesus would do requires radical changes in our lives. Perhaps for the first time we would also experience the "reign of God" proclaimed by Jesus." &#x2014; Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton, Auxiliary Bishop, Archdiocese of Detroit (Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton)<br><br>"The real Jesus is missing&#x2014;or has been banished&#x2014;and Nelson-Pallmeyer, a scholar, activist, author and regular contributor to Sojourners magazine, wants to find him again....No accomodationist, Nelson-Pallmeyer cannot find any place for violence, even when exercised against evil."&#x2014;Publishers Weekly, July 23, 2001 (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"especially provocative...incite us to grapple with what it means to follow Jesus."&#x2014;The Other Side, March &amp; April 2002 (<i>The Other Side Of Show Business</i>)<br><br>"This important book should be read by every pastor or Christian educator for several reasons, not the least of which is that it confronts readers with some of the horrendous material in the Bible and forces them to come to terms with it. Such an exercise also has the advantage of raising the larger issue of the Bible&#x2019;s inconsistencies and the necessity of reading the Bible critically. The reader will get a clear introduction to a leading trend of New Testament scholarship. If Christianity is to remain intellectually and ethically relevant, pastors and educators will have to rethink its fundamentals. This book is an excellent and accessible place to start."&#x2014;Max A. Myers, Interpretation July 2002. (Max A. Myers <i>Interpretation</i>)<br><br>"The audacious character of Nelson-Pallmeyer's book is his willingness to probe troublesome aspects of the faith and the Christian tradition, which too infrequently get a public hearing. He is engaging and provocative in his treatment of his subject...His commitment to nonviolence is uncompromising and unwavering. What is finally important, however, is not so much whether one agrees with any or all that he says but whether one is willing to engage the questions with him. To do so will be both disturbing and stimulating, but finally rewarding."&#x2014;Randy A. Nelson,Director of Contextual Education at Luther Seminary, Saint Paul, MN. Review for RE-Imaging November 2001 (Randy A. Nelson)<br><br>"Nelson-Pallmeyer articulates arguments likely to interest general readers. Against Luke Timothy Johnson and others who dismiss the search for the historical Jesus as misguided, he argues that it is an important corrective to historical distortions of Christianity and to the 'pathological violence' of the God(s) depicted by the Bible's 'messy monotheism' . . . Anything but passive, Nelson-Pallmeyer's radical pacifism sends sparks flying in all directions." &#x2014;Booklist<br><br>&#x201c;It was the boldness of the title that attracted me to this book, and I was most certainly not disappointed in the content. This is one of the most exciting and challenging explorations of faith that I have read for a long time.... Although thoroughly scholarly and well-researched, this book is as easy to read as the mystery story it claims to be in its vital search for the &#x2018;hidden Jesus.&#x2019; If we are seriously seeking a way to resist in our present crisis, I cannot think of a more exciting starting place.&#x201d; &#x2013;Coracle: Magazine of Iona Community, October 13, 2004<br><br>"Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer joins a distinguished company of writers who, as an act of faithfulness, are attempting to reinvent Christianity.

Born and raised in Germantown and Mt. Airy, Karrie now lives in Center City. <br><br>Karrie attended Central High School of Philadelphia and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in English at Penn State University and a master's degree in journalism at Temple University. Her interest in writing about Philadelphia was sparked during her time as editor of <em>Campus Philly</em>, a local nonprofit where she was responsible for creating online and print guides and a magazine about Philadelphia for local college students.<br><br>Karrie is the former Philadelphia/South Jersey Guide for the website About.com, and her writing has appeared in numerous regional and national magazines, including <em>Philadelphia</em> magazine, <em>Philadelphia Wedding, Philadelphia Home, AAA World</em>, and <em>US Airways</em> magazine, and in the anthology <em>PS: What I Didn't Say</em>, published by Seal Press. Her deep Philly roots and knowledge also serve her (and her clients) well in her work as a real estate agent at Elfant Wissahickon Realtors.<br><br>In her spare time, Karrie assists adults with special needs on vacations and local outings through Special Vacations, an organization founded by her mother. She also enjoys hanging out with her husband, her two sons, their dog, and her large network of family and friends. Luckily for her, they are almost all in Philly! While Philadelphians may leave for a while, they almost always come back.In penning her love letter to Philadelphia, local author Karrie Gavin dusted off 350 years of history and delved into her own personal chronicles. She shared Philly's centuries-old stories and spilled its best-kept secrets, all from the perspective of a 32-year-old born, raised and now residing in the City of Brotherly Love. The result is Moon Philadelphia, a new guidebook from Avalon Travel that celebrates Gavin's loyalty to her hometown as much as it teaches visitors about Philadelphia's tourist attractions....What sets the backpack-friendly book apart from previous area guides is that a single local author was chosen to research, organize, photograph and write up the native flavor. --The Philadelphia Inquirer, September 24, 2008<br><br>"It's obvious [Karrie Gavin's] got a love for Philadelphia...she visited hundreds of restaurants, tourist sites and neighborhoods to research and write the book that reads like a friendly conversation.

S. Army opened fire on an encampment of Sioux Indians led by Big Foot. Coming two weeks after the killing of Sitting Bull, in a tense atmosphere of suspicion and misunderstanding, the careless discharge of one gun set off a massacre that claimed more than 250 lives, including those of many Indian women and children. The tragedy at Wounded Knee, which is generally considered the last episode of the Indian Wars, has often been written about but the existing photographs have received little attention until now. <p><i>Eyewitness at Wounded Knee</i> brings together and assesses for the first time some 150 photographs that were made before and immediately after the massacre. Present at the scene were two itinerant photographers, George Trager and Clarence Grant Moreledge, whose work has never before been published. Accompanying commentaries focus on both the Indian and military sides of the story. Richard Jensen's "Another Look at Wounded Knee" dwells on the political and economic quagmire in which the Sioux found themselves after 1877. In "Your Country Is Surrounded," R. Eli Paul discusses the army's role at Wounded Knee. John Carter, in "Making Pictures for a News-Hungry Nation," deals with the photographers and also the reporters and relic hunters who were looking to profit from the misfortune of others. Their words enhance our appreciation of the haunting images in this first book-length photographic history of the events that led up to and followed the bloodshed at Wounded Knee.</p></p><p>James A. Hanson, director of the Nebraska State Historical Society, notes in his foreword the importance of the photographs as primary historical sources. Richard E. Jensen and R.

Vivekananda was an important Indian teacher who came to this country just over a century ago and taught Hindu meditation practice and religious philosophy. Raja Yoga means the &#34;discipline of meditation practice,&#34; as opposed to Hatha Yoga, which means the &#34;discipline of physical stretching exercises.&#34; Raja Yoga is one of the most well-known books by Vivekananda, who also wrote books on Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Jnana Yoga. According to the author, the goal of Raja Yoga is to concentrate the mind and to discover the innermost recesses of our own mind. In order to obtain the goal, practice is absolutely necessary. The appendix contains the translation of the Patanjali Yoga Aphorisms.</p><p><b>Excerpt:<br></b> Rousing the Kundalini is the one and only way to attain Divine Wisdom. The rousing may come in various ways: through love for God, through the mercy of perfected sages, or through the power of the analytic will of the philosopher. <p>Wherever there was any manifestation of what is ordinarily called supernatural power or wisdom, there a little current of Kundalini must have found its way into the Sushumna. Only, in the vast majority of such cases, the people had ignorantly stumbled on some practice which set free a minute portion of the coiled-up Kundalini. All worship, consciously or unconsciously, leads to this end. </p><p>The man who thinks that he is receiving response to his prayers does not know that the fulfillment comes from his own nature, that he has succeeded by the mental attitude of prayer in waking up a bit of this infinite power which is coiled up within himself. Thus, what people ignorantly worship under various names, through fear and tribulation, the Yogi declares to the world to be the real power coiled up in every being, the Mother of eternal happiness, if we but know how to approach her. And Raja-Yoga is the science of religion, the rationale of all worship, all prayers, forms, ceremonies, and miracles.</p></p><h2>Living Alphabet</h2><p>The reader is challenged to find a variety of things in pictures featuring each letter of the alphabet.</p><p>Famke Zonneveld, born in Indonesia in 1938, is an art teacher and an artist in watercolor, stained glass, lazure wall painting, and fiber arts.

After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in English and Creative Writing, she moved to New York City where she worked in magazine publishing and marketing for nine years. She currently lives in Atlanta with her husband and daughter. This is her first novel.Aibileen<br><br>chapter 1<br><br>August 1962<br><br>Mae Mobley was born on a early Sunday morning in August 1960. A church baby we like to call it. Taking care a white babies, that's what I do, along with all the cooking and the cleaning. I done raised seventeen kids in my lifetime. I know how to get them babies to sleep, stop crying, and go in the toilet bowl before they mamas even get out a bed in the morning.<br><br>But I ain't never seen a baby yell like Mae Mobley Leefolt. First day I walk in the door, there she be, red-hot and hollering with the colic, fighting that bottle like it's a rotten turnip. Miss Leefolt, she look terrified a her own child. "What am I doing wrong? Why can't I stop it?"<br><br>It? That was my first hint: something is wrong with this situation.<br><br>So I took that pink, screaming baby in my arms. Bounced her on my hip to get the gas moving and it didn't take two minutes fore Baby Girl stopped her crying, got to smiling up at me like she do. But Miss Leefolt, she don't pick up her own baby for the rest a the day. I seen plenty a womens get the baby blues after they done birthing. I reckon I thought that's what it was.<br><br>Here's something about Miss Leefolt: she not just frowning all the time, she skinny. Her legs is so spindly, she look like she done growed em last week. Twenty-three years old and she lanky as a fourteen-year-old boy. Even her hair is thin, brown, see-through. She try to tease it up, but it only make it look thinner. Her face be the same shape as that red devil on the redhot candy box, pointy chin and all. Fact, her whole body be so full a sharp knobs and corners, it's no wonder she can't soothe that baby. Babies like fat. Like to bury they face up in you armpit and go to sleep. They like big fat legs too. That I know.<br><br>By the time she a year old, Mae Mobley following me around everwhere I go. Five o'clock would come round and she'd be hanging on my Dr. Scholl shoe, dragging over the floor, crying like I weren't never coming back. Miss Leefolt, she'd narrow up her eyes at me like I done something wrong, unhitch that crying baby off my foot. I reckon that's the risk you run, letting somebody else raise you chilluns.<br><br>Mae Mobley two years old now. She got big brown eyes and honey-color curls. But the bald spot in the back of her hair kind a throw things off. She get the same wrinkle between her eyebrows when she worried, like her mama. They kind a favor except Mae Mobley so fat. She ain't gone be no beauty queen. I think it bother Miss Leefolt, but Mae Mobley my special baby.<br><br>I lost my own boy, Treelore, right before I started waiting on Miss Leefolt. He was twenty-four years old. The best part of a personï¿½s life. It just wasnï¿½t enough time living in this world.<br><br>He had him a little apartment over on Foley Street. Seeing a real nice girl name Frances and I spec they was gone get married, but he was slow bout things like that. Not cause he looking for something better, just cause he the thinking kind. Wore big glasses and reading all the time. He even start writing his own book, bout being a colored man living and working in Mississippi. Law, that made me proud. But one night he working late at the Scanlon-Taylor mill, lugging two-by-fours to the truck, splinters slicing all the way through the glove. He too small for that kind a work, too skinny, but he needed the job. He was tired. It was raining. He slip off the loading dock, fell down on the drive. Tractor trailer didn't see him and crushed his lungs fore he could move. By the time I found out, he was dead.<br><br>That was the day my whole world went black. Air look black, sun look black. I laid up in bed and stared at the black walls a my house. Minny came ever day to make sure I was still breathing, feed me food to keep me living. Took three months fore I even look out the window, see if the world still there. I was surprise to see the world didn't stop just cause my boy did.<br><br>Five months after the funeral, I lifted myself up out a bed. I put on my white uniform and put my little gold cross back around my neck and I went to wait on Miss Leefolt cause she just have her baby girl. But it weren't too long before I seen something in me had changed. A bitter seed was planted inside a me. And I just didn't feel so accepting anymore.<br><br>ï¿½Get the house straightened up and then go on and fix some of that chicken salad now,ï¿½ say Miss Leefolt.<br><br>It's bridge club day. Every fourth Wednesday a the month. A course I already got everthing ready to go-made the chicken salad this morning, ironed the tablecloths yesterday. Miss Leefolt seen me at it too. She ain't but twenty-three years old and she like hearing herself tell me what to do.<br><br>She already got the blue dress on I ironed this morning, the one with sixty-five pleats on the waist, so tiny I got to squint through my glasses to iron. I don't hate much in life, but me and that dress is not on good terms.<br><br>"And you make sure Mae Mobley's not coming in on us, now. I tell you, I am so burned up at her-tore up my good stationery into five thousand pieces and I've got fifteen thank-you notes for the Junior League to do . . ."<br><br>I arrange the-this and the-that for her lady friends. Set out the good crystal, put the silver service out. Miss Leefolt don't put up no dinky card table like the other ladies do. We set at the dining room table. Put a cloth on top to cover the big L-shaped crack, move that red flower centerpiece to the sideboard to hide where the wood all scratched. Miss Leefolt, she like it fancy when she do a luncheon. Maybe she trying to make up for her house being small. They ain't rich folk, that I know. Rich folk don't try so hard.<br><br>I'm used to working for young couples, but I spec this is the smallest house I ever worked in. It's just the one story. Her and Mister Leefolt's room in the back be a fair size, but Baby Girl's room be tiny. The dining room and the regular living room kind a join up. Only two bathrooms, which is a relief cause I worked in houses where they was five or six. Take a whole day just to clean toilets. Miss Leefolt don't pay but ninety-five cents an hour, less than I been paid in years. But after Treelore died, I took what I could. Landlord wasn't gone wait much longer. And even though it's small, Miss Leefolt done the house up nice as she can. She pretty good with the sewing machine. Anything she can't buy new of, she just get her some blue material and sew it a cover.<br><br>The doorbell ring and I open it up.<br><br>"Hey, Aibileen," Miss Skeeter say, cause she the kind that speak to the help. "How you?"<br><br>"Hey, Miss Skeeter. I'm alright. Law, it's hot out there."<br><br>Miss Skeeter real tall and skinny. Her hair be yellow and cut short above her shoulders cause she get the frizz year round. She twenty-three or so, same as Miss Leefolt and the rest of em. She set her pocketbook on the chair, kind a itch around in her clothes a second. She wearing a white lace blouse buttoned up like a nun, flat shoes so I reckon she don't look any taller. Her blue skirt gaps open in the waist. Miss Skeeter always look like somebody else told her what to wear.<br><br>I hear Miss Hilly and her mama, Miss Walter, pull up the driveway and toot the horn. Miss Hilly don't live but ten feet away, but she always drive over. I let her in and she go right past me and I figure it's a good time to get Mae Mobley up from her nap.<br><br>Soon as I walk in her nursery, Mae Mobley smile at me, reach out her fat little arms.<br><br>"You already up, Baby Girl? Why you didn't holler for me?"<br><br>She laugh, dance a little happy jig waiting on me to get her out. I give her a good hug. I reckon she don't get too many good hugs like this after I go home. Ever so often, I come to work and find her bawling in her crib, Miss Leefolt busy on the sewing machine rolling her eyes like it's a stray cat stuck in the screen door. See, Miss Leefolt, she dress up nice ever day. Always got her makeup on, got a carport, double-door Frigidaire with the built-in icebox. You see her in the Jitney 14 grocery, you never think she go and leave her baby crying in her crib like that. But the help always know.<br><br>Today is a good day though. That girl just grins.<br><br>I say, "Aibileen."<br><br>She say, "Aib-ee."<br><br>I say, "Love."<br><br>She say, "Love."<br><br>I say, "Mae Mobley."<br><br>She say, "Aib-ee." And then she laugh and laugh. She so tickled she talking and I got to say, it's about time. Treelore didn't say nothing till he two either. By the time he in third grade, though, he get to talking better than the President a the United States, coming home using words like conjugation and parliamentary. He get in junior high and we play this game where I give him a real simple word and he got to come up with a fancy one like it. I say house cat, he say domesticized feline, I say mixer and he say motorized rotunda. One day I say Crisco. He scratch his head. He just can't believe I done won the game with something simple as Crisco. Came to be a secret joke with us, meaning something you can't dress up no matter how you try. We start calling his daddy Crisco cause you can't fancy up a man done run off on his family. Plus he the greasiest no-count you ever known.<br><br>I tote Mae Mobley into the kitchen and put her in her high chair, thinking about two chores I need to finish today fore Miss Leefolt have a fit: separate the napkins that started to fray and straighten up the silver service in the cabinet. Law, I'm on have to do it while the ladies is here, I guess.<br><br>I take the tray a devil eggs out to the dining room. Miss Leefolt setting at the head and to her left be Miss Hilly Holbrook and Miss Hilly's mama, Miss Walter, who Miss Hilly don't treat with no respect. And then on Miss Leefolt's right be Miss Skeeter.<br><br>I make the egg rounds, starting with ole Miss Walter first cause she the elder. It's warm in here, but she got a thick brown sweater drooped around her shoulders. She scoop a egg up and near bout drop it cause she getting the palsy. Then I move over to Miss Hilly and she smile and take two. Miss Hilly got a round face and dark brown hair in the beehive. Her skin be olive color, with freckles and moles. She wear a lot a red plaid. And she getting heavy in the bottom. Today, since it's so hot, she wearing a red sleeveless dress with no waist to it. She one a those grown ladies that still dress like a little girl with big bows and matching hats and such. She ain't my favorite.<br><br>I move over to Miss Skeeter, but she wrinkle her nose up at me and say, "No, thanks," cause she don't eat no eggs. I tell Miss Leefolt ever time she have the bridge club and she make me do them eggs anyways. She scared Miss Hilly be disappointed.<br><br>Finally, I do Miss Leefolt. She the hostess so she got to pick up her eggs last. And soon as I'm done, Miss Hilly say, "Don't mind if I do," and snatch herself two more eggs, which don't surprise me.<br><br>"Guess who I ran into at the beauty parlor?" Miss Hilly say to the ladies.<br><br>"Who's that?" ask Miss Leefolt.<br><br>"Celia Foote. And do you know what she asked me? If she could help with the Benefit this year."<br><br>"Good," Miss Skeeter say. "We need it."<br><br>"Not that bad, we don't. I told her, I said, 'Celia, you have to be a League member or a sustainer to participate.' What does she think the Jackson League is? Open rush?"<br><br>"Aren't we taking nonmembers this year? Since the Benefit's gotten so big?" Miss Skeeter ask.<br><br>"Well, yes," Miss Hilly say. "But I wasn't about to tell her that."<br><br>"I can't believe Johnny married a girl so tacky like she is," Miss Leefolt say and Miss Hilly nod. She start dealing out the bridge cards.<br><br>I spoon out the congealed salad and the ham sandwiches, can't help but listen to the chatter. Only three things them ladies talk about: they kids, they clothes, and they friends. I hear the word Kennedy, I know they ain't discussing no politic. They talking about what Miss Jackie done wore on the tee-vee.<br><br>When I get around to Miss Walter, she don't take but one little old half a sandwich for herself.<br><br>"Mama," Miss Hilly yell at Miss Walter, "take another sandwich. You are skinny as a telephone pole." Miss Hilly look over at the rest a the table. "I keep telling her, if that Minny can't cook she needs to just go on and fire her."<br><br>My ears perk up at this. They talking bout the help. I'm best friends with Minny.<br><br>"Minny cooks fine," say ole Miss Walter. "I'm just not so hungry like I used to be."<br><br>Minny near bout the best cook in Hinds County, maybe even all a Mississippi. The Junior League Benefit come around ever fall and they be wanting her to make ten caramel cakes to auction off. She ought a be the most sought-after help in the state. Problem is, Minny got a mouth on her. She always talking back. One day it be the white manager a the Jitney Jungle grocery, next day it be her husband, and ever day it's gone be the white lady she waiting on. The only reason she waiting on Miss Walter so long is Miss Walter be deaf as a doe-nob.</p><h2>Gravitation Collection Volume 6</h2><p>This is a gorgeous re-packaging of the bestselling shonen-ai manga series!

In 1939 the tiny Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) became the first to take up battle stations even before the outbreak of the Second World War. The three Rhodesian squadrons served with distinction in East Africa, the Western Desert, Italy and Western Europe. At home Rhodesia became a vast training ground for airmen from across the Empire-from Britain, the Commonwealth and even Greece. <br><br>After the war, Rhodesia, on a negligible budget, rebuilt its air force, equipping it with Ansons, Spitfires, Vampires, Canberras, Hunters and Alouettes. Following UDI, the unilateral declaration of independence from Britain in 1965, international sanctions were imposed, resulting in many remarkable and groundbreaking innovations, particularly in the way of ordnance. The bitter 'bush war' followed in the late 1960s and '70s, with the RhAF in the vanguard of local counterinsurgency operations and audacious preemptive strikes against vast guerrilla bases in neighboring Mozambique, Zambia and Botswana and as far afield as Angola and Tanzania. With its aging fleet, including C-47 'Dakotas' that had been at Arnhem, the RhAF was able to wreak untold havoc on the enemy, Mugabe's ZANLA and Nkomo's ZIPRA. The late author took over 30 years in writing this book; the result is a comprehensive record that reflects the pride, professionalism and dedication of what were some of the world's finest airmen of their time.<br><br>The late Beryl Salt was born in London in 1931. She emigrated to Southern Rhodesia in 1952 to get married in Salisbury, where her two sons were born. In 1953 she joined the Southern Rhodesian Broadcasting Services (later the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation, the RBC). With a love of history she wanted to find out as much as she could about her new country. This interest led to radio dramas and feature programmes, followed by several books: School History Text Book, The Encyclopaedia of Rhodesia and The Valiant Years, a history of the country as seen through the newspapers. She also produced a dramatized radio series about the Rhodesian Air Force. In 1965 she left the RBC and spent three years with the Ministry of Information, following which she was a freelance writer/broadcaster involved in a wide variety of projects until 1980 when she moved to Cape Town. She died in England in November 2001.</p><p>The late Beryl Salt was born in London in 1931. She emigrated to Southern Rhodesia in 1952 to get married in Salisbury, where her two sons were born.

Recently, he has emerged as an active participant in the debates over the Global, European and Greek Crises as well as a co-founder of www.vitalspace.org."The book is one of those exceedingly rare publications of which one can say they are urgent, timely and absolutely necessary." - Terry Eagleton<br>"Yanis is one of the best, brightest and most innovative economists on the planet" - Steve Keen, author of <em>Debunking Economics<br></em><br>"In the most comprehensive guide to the contemporary economic crisis yet written, Yanis Varoufakis traces out the path from post-war US economic supremacy to the current predicament. This book's provocative thesis, written in lively and impassioned prose, is that which neither the US nor the EU nor any other nation can now restore robust global growth. Whether you agree or disagree, this book's lively and impassioned prose will engage you both heart and mind, and hold you in thrall to the last word.

With much eloquence, Yanis Varoufakis argues that the current financial problems are connected to the emerging fault lines of the international monetary system. The US (the Minotaur) used to govern the international monetary system, but no more; and this crucially means that there is no surplus recycling mechanism that can reliably stabilise the world economy. The elephant in the room, so to speak, is a stumbling Minotaur." - Prof. Shaun Hargreaves-Heap, University of East Anglia<br>"Yanis Varoufakis is a rare economist: skilled at explaining ideas, happy to join in public debates and able to put his discipline in a broader context.

Lawrence was kindled by her favorable review of <i>The White Peacock</i> (1911). They met in 1914 and their relationship lasted until Lawrence's death in. In 1916 she and Lawrence exchanged manuscripts of <i>Open the Door!</i> and Women in Love. Her novel was completed in 1918 and won the Melrose Prize on publication in 1920. Her other novel, <i>The Camomile</i>, was published two years later, after which she devoted herself to <i>The Life of Robert Burns</i>, which made her name in 1930. This was quickly followed by a biography of Lawrence, <i>The Savage Pilgrimage</i> (1932). She worked with John Buchan's widow on his memorial anthology, <i>The Clearing House</i> (1946) and on her own autobiography, which was published, incomplete, as <i>Lying Awake</i> in 1950. Carswell died in Oxford at the age of 66.</p><h2>Daughter of the Loom</h2><p>Book 1 of THE BELLS OF LOWELL. The mill town of Lowell, Massachusetts, comes to life with intrigue and drama from the creative writing team of Judith Miller and Tracie Peterson. Young women at the end of the 19th century seek employment from driven men intent on transforming America&#39;s textile industry. Daughtersof the Loom features Lilly Armbruster, who is forced to work in the mills as her only means for survival. But Lilly&#39;s resentment runs deep against the &#34;lords of the loom&#34;--the men she believes have stolen her father&#39;s farm and caused his premature death. Her animosity happens to include Matthew Cheever, her childhood friend and one-time betrothed. Though separated by their opposing views about the future of the mill and the community that surrounds it, the emotions of their hearts still bind them. Will their dreams for the future allow their fragile love to survive?</p><p>Tracie Peterson is a full-time author who has written or co-written over fifty novels in both historical and contemporary genres, including the WESTWARD CHRONICLES, the YUKON QUEST and the SHANNON SAGA series. <p>Tracie also teaches writing workshops at a variety of conferences on subjects including inspirational romance and historical research. She and her family live in Montana.</p>Two veteran novelists team up in this evangelical Christian historical fiction series debut that explores interesting social issues, but eventually falls flat. Nineteenth-century New England is in the throes of change as it morphs from an agricultural economy to textile industry. Caught in the growing pains of her little town of Lowell, Mass., is the comely Lilly Armbruster, who has lost the family farm through the death of her parents and the greed of her older brother. Her devotion to the ambitious Matthew Cheever is dispelled when he seemingly sells out his values to become the prot&#x201a;g&#x201a; of a dubious business mentor. Lilly contracts to work in the textile mills with the idea of becoming an "instrument of God" and sabotaging the business that she feels has cost her everything she loves. The story begins promisingly enough with some discerning historical insights about the problems of industrialization for women and ethnic groups (sexual harassment, poor working conditions, prejudicial treatment), but the pacing is slow, the dialogue and actions are often wooden and the abundant sermonizing is a constant distraction. Although there are some surprises in the character development of Lilly and Matthew, other characters are one-dimensional and undergo unbelievable transformations too quickly. The sulky Lilly is also difficult for the reader to like. However, fans of Peterson and Miller will likely appreciate that the authors wrap up enough loose ends to make this work not only as a stand-alone title but also as an introduction to the series. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Monkey and the Wrench: Essays into Contemporary Poetics (Akron Series in Contemporary Poetics)</h2><p><i>The Monkey and the Wrench: Essays into Contemporary Poetics</i> takes a snapshot of a moving target: the ever-shifting conversation about today's poetry.

Critics in the last twenty<br>years, who have focused on the overtly sexual relationship between<br>Edward and his favourite Gaveston, have hailed it as a 'gay classic';<br>earlier interpretations concentrated rather on the deposition by his<br>subjects of a weak king, reading it in tandem with Shakespeare's<br>Richard II. The introduction shows how the play works to give the<br>audience an equal emotional commitment to opposing points of view and<br>concludes that this is what makes Edward II such an uncomfortable and<br>challenging play.</p><p><p> Depicting with shocking openness the sexual and political violence of its central characters&#x2019; fates, <em>Edward the Second</em> broke new dramatic ground in English theatre. The play charts the tragic rise and fall of the medieval English monarch Edward the Second, his favourite Piers Gaveston, and their ambitious opponents Queen Isabella and Mortimer Jr., and is an important cultural, as well as dramatic, document of the early modern period. </p> <p> This modernized and fully annotated Broadview Edition is prefaced by a critical but student-oriented introduction and followed by ample appendix material, including extended selections from Marlowe&#x2019;s historical sources, texts bearing on the play&#x2019;s complex sexual and political dynamics, and excerpts from contemporary poet Michael Drayton&#x2019;s epic rendition of Edward the Second&#x2019;s reign. </p>Charles R.

Here is the full epic story of Belgarath, the great sorcerer learned in the Will and the Word on whom the fate of the world depends. Only Belgarath can tell of those near-forgotten times when Gods still walked the land: he is the Ancient One, the Old Wolf, his God Aldur&#39;s first and most-favoured disciple. Using powers learned over the centuries Belgarath himself records the story of conflict between two mortally opposed Destinies that split the world asunder. A hugely entertaining work of great daring, wit, grandeur and excitement that confirms the role of Belgarath the Sorcerer as one of the mightiest fantasy creations of the century.</p><p>The age-old war was ended at last, and Destiny once again rolled on in its proper course. Only a single person remained to tell of the near-forgotten times when Gods still walked the lands, giving comfort and counsel to their mortal children. Only one man alive could speak with certain knowledge of how the Dark God Torak stole the Orb of Aldur and broke the very world apart, consigning the Gods themselves to the hell of war, along with hapless humanity. Only one individual was left who could relate the whole, fearsome story. That lone witness to history was known to all the world. He was called the Ancient One, the Old Wolf - Belgarath the Sorcerer. And he had been a part of that history from the beginning. Here, then, is his tale in full: the story of the strife that split the world asunder and of how the God Aldur and his chosen disciples would toil to set Destiny aright - a monumental undertaking fated to span the eons. Foremost in the chronicles of that labor would be Belgarath. His ceaseless devotion was foredoomed to cost him the very thing he held most dear - and his loyal service would extend on, through the echoing centuries of loss, of struggle, and of ultimate triumph.t--the life story of Belgarath the Sorcerer and the great struggle that went before the Belgariad and The Malloreon.

The book traces Jews' often tumultuous encounter with race from the 1870s through World War II, when they became vested as part of America's white mainstream and abandoned the practice of describing themselves in racial terms.</p><br><p> American Jewish history is often told as a story of quick and successful adaptation, but Goldstein demonstrates how the process of identifying as white Americans was an ambivalent one, filled with hard choices and conflicting emotions for Jewish immigrants and their children. Jews enjoyed a much greater level of social inclusion than African Americans, but their membership in white America was frequently made contingent on their conformity to prevailing racial mores and on the eradication of their perceived racial distinctiveness. While Jews consistently sought acceptance as whites, their tendency to express their own group bonds through the language of "race" led to deep misgivings about what was required of them.</p><br><p> Today, despite the great success Jews enjoy in the United States, they still struggle with the constraints of America's black-white dichotomy. <i>The Price of Whiteness</i> concludes that while Jews' status as white has opened many doors for them, it has also placed limits on their ability to assert themselves as a group apart.</p></p><p><p>"This is an outstanding book. It offers scholars and general readers a complicated, nuanced, and sophisticated engagement with [the] issue."<b>--Hasia R.

He wrote the earliest essay in this book in September 1914, before he cemented his fame with the novels Steppenwolf and Siddhartha, and continued writing a stream of letters, essays and pamphlets throughout the war. In his native Germany his views earned him the labels &#39;traitor&#39; and &#39;viper&#39;, but after World War II he was moved to reiterate his beliefs in another series of essays and letters.If the War Goes On . . . resonates as strongly today as it did when originally published and begs the question: have our politicians learnt nothing in the last seventy years?</p><p></p><h2>The Giant Book Of Insults: Incorporating 2000 Insults for All Occasions and 2000 More Insults</h2><p>Here is a lively collection of sharp retorts and ripostes, pithy pot-shots, caustic quips and polite and not-so-polite putdowns.

Berr brought a keen literary sensibility to her writing, a talent that renders the story it relates all the more rich, all the more heartbreaking. <br><br>The first day Berr has to wear the yellow star on her coat, she writes, &#x201c;I held my head high and looked people so straight in the eye they turned away. But it&#x2019;s hard.&#x201d; More, many more, humiliations were to follow, which she records, now with a view to posterity. She wants the journal to go to her fiancï¿½, who has enrolled with the Free French Forces, as she knows she may not live much longer. She was right. The final entry is dated February 15, 1944, and ends with the chilling words: &#x201c;Horror! Horror! Horror!&#x201d; Berr and her family were arrested three weeks later. She went &#x2014; as was discovered later &#x2014; on the death march from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen, where she died of typhus in April 1945, within a month of Anne Frank and just days before the liberation of the camp.<br><br>The journal did eventually reach her fiancï¿½, and for over fifty years it was kept private. In 2002, it was donated to the Memorial of the Shoah in Paris. Before it was first published in France in January 2008, translation rights had already been sold for twelve languages.</p><p>David Bellos is the first ever winner of the Man Booker International Translator&#x2019;s prize for his translations of the distinguished Albanian writer, Ismail Kadare.

Yesterday evening, after my day at the library, it had returned to such normality that I could hardly believe what had happened the previous day. Since yesterday it has turned again. When I got home just now, Maman announced that there was a great deal of hope for Papa. On the one hand, there&#x2019;s Papa&#x2019;s return. On the other, this departure for the Free Zone. Each of these things brings its own trial. The departure gave me a feeling almost of despair, I can&#x2019;t work out why. I came home geared up for the struggle, united with the good against the bad; I had been to see Mme Biï¿½der, that poor mother of eight whose husband has been deported; she lives in Faubourg Saint-Denis. Denise and I stayed with her for a quarter of an hour; as we left, I felt almost glad to have plunged myself into real suffering. I definitely felt that I was guilty, that there was something I hadn&#x2019;t been <i>seeing</i>, and that this was reality. This woman&#x2019;s sister who has four children has been taken away. On the evening of the round-up she had gone into hiding, but fate had her come back down to see the concierge just when the policeman was coming to get her. Mme Biï¿½der is like a hunted animal. She&#x2019;s not afraid for herself. But she&#x2019;s afraid they&#x2019;ll take her children away. Some of the children they took had to be dragged along the floor. In Montmartre there were so many arrests that the streets were jammed. Faubourg Saint-Denis has nearly been emptied. Mothers have been separated from their children. <br><br>I&#x2019;m noting the facts, in haste, so as not to forget them, because we <i>must not </i>forget.<br><br>In Mlle Monsaingeon&#x2019;s neighbourhood, a whole family, the father, the mother and five children, gassed themselves to escape the round-up. <br><br>One woman threw herself out of a window. <br><br>Apparently several policeman have been shot for warning people so they could escape. They were threatened with the concentration camp if they failed to obey. Who is going to feed the internees at Drancy now their wives have been arrested? The kids will never find their parents again. What are the longer-term consequences of what happened at dawn the day before yesterday? <br><br>Margot&#x2019;s cousin, who left last week, and we knew she hadn&#x2019;t succeeded in her attempt, was caught at the demarcation line and thrown into jail after they&#x2019;d interrogated her eleven-year-old son for hours to get him to confess that she was Jewish; she has diabetes, and four days later she was dead. It&#x2019;s over. The prison matron had her moved to a hospital when she went into a coma, but it was too late. <br><br>On the mï¿½tro I met Mme Baur, looking as gorgeous as ever. But she was worn out. She did not recognize me straight away. She seemed amazed that we were still there. I always want to be proud when responding to that. She told me we would have lots to do at the U.G.I.F. She didn&#x2019;t hide the fact that it would soon be the turn of women who were French citizens. When she mentioned Odile, it seemed like something very far away. <br><br>But if we have to leave, to leave and abandon struggle and heroism in exchange for dullness and despondency &#x2014; no, I&#x2019;ll do something. The common people are admirable. Apparently quite a lot of factory girls lived with Jews.

During The Cold War, a burned-out spy accepts a last assignment that involves him being intentionally recruited by East German intelligence. As he proceeds with his mission, he discovers that he&#39;s lost his taste for spying and now questions the rightness of rules he once obeyed without question. With its intricate twists and double-crosses, THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD works as a wonderful thriller--its authenticity heightened by Le Carre&#39;s work in Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service--but it is the book&#39;s profound questioning of the moral consequences of covert operations in the name of &#34;freedom&#34; that has made it a classic.</p><p></p><h2>Fitzgerald and Hemingway: A Dangerous Friendship</h2><p>Fifteen years&#39; worth of startling new research material is presented by special permission of the Hemingway estate in this revised edition of the correspondence between 1925 and 1940, including a group of Hemingway&#39;s letters about Fitzgerald.</p><p>Matthew J. Bruccoli is the Jefferies Professor of English at the University of South Carolina.Bruccoli's ongoing fascination with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway has resulted in his writing and editing some 25 books, including the excellent <i>F. Scott Fitzgerald: A Life in Letters</i> and a popular volume titled <i>Scott and Ernest</i> (1978), which examined the tenuous friendship between these two very different and very talented writers. But this original anatomy of a literary friendship was written under one rather crucial restriction: Hemingway's letters had not yet been published and could not, therefore, be quoted. Now that these and other vital materials have become available, Bruccoli returns to the scene and reassesses their uneasy relationship. His summation is perfect: "Hemingway needed a claque. Fitzgerald needed heroes," statements Bruccoli supports with an engaging analysis of their letters to each other as well as letters to colleagues, especially Maxwell Perkins. Bruccoli does a fine job of exposing the myths the two men created about themselves as armor for their fragile egos, and works hard to identify the truth behind the many now apocryphal tales about these two compelling rivals. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Language and Imagery of the Bible</h2><p><p>'A very vigorous, detailed and illuminating study of the uses of language, especially of figurative language, in scripture' -<i> Amos N.

Muhammad Ali met George Foreman in the ring. Foreman&#39;s genius employed silence, serenity and cunning. He had never been defeated. His hands were his instrument, and &#39;he kept them in his pockets the way a hunter lays his rifle back into its velvet case&#39;. Together the two men made boxing history in an explosive meeting of two great minds, two iron wills and monumental egos.</p><p>There are sporting events that transcend the world of sports, and the 1974 heavyweight title fight in which Muhammad Ali regained his crown by improbably kayoing George Foreman in the middle of the African night was certainly one of them. Metaphorically, it was a writer&#39;s dream: two imposing black warriors, one all grace, the other brute force, one the iconoclast, the other the blind patriot, battling each other. Fatefully, the appropriate writer threw his pen into the ring. Norman Mailer&#39;s masterful account goes far beyond the ropes to capture the primal ethos of the sport, the larger social canvas this particular fight was drawn on, and the remarkable cast of personalities--not the least of which is Mailer himself--who converged to make this &#34;Rumble in the Jungle&#34; a landmark in sports history and a clear knockout in Mailer&#39;s journalistic portfolio."Entertaining... Mailer continues his familiar shadow-boxing with the ineffable." -- Time<p>In 1975 in Kinshasa, Zaire, at the virtual center of Africa, two African American boxers were paid five million dollars apiece to fight each other until one was declared winner. One was Muhammad Ali, the aging but irrepressible "professor of boxing" who vowed to reclaim the championship he had lost. The other was George Foreman, who was as taciturn as Ali was voluble and who kept his hands in his pockets "the way a hunter lays his rifle back into its velvet case." Observing them was Norman Mailer, whose grasp of the titanic battle's feints and stratagems -- and whose sensitivity to their deeper symbolism -- make this book a masterpiece of the literature of sport.</p><p>Whether he is analyzing the fighters' moves, interpreting their characters, or weighing their competing claims on the African and American souls, Mailer is a commentator of unparalleled energy, acumen, and audacity -- and surely one of the few intrepid enough to accompany Ali on a late-night run through the bush. In The Fight he restores our tarnished notions of heroism to a blinding gleam -- and establishes himself as a champion in his own right.</p><p>"An admirable entertainment....

Courtesans &amp; fishcakes: the consuming passions of classical Athens. xxvi, 371 p., [8] p. of plates : ill. ; 25 cm.. . Includes bibliographical references (p. 353-362) and index.. .</p><p>Desire is a dangerous thing, and the relationship between the citizens of ancient Athens and their desires was a complex and troubled one. James Davidson's <i>Courtesans and Fishcakes</i> is a brilliant and kaleidoscopic examination of daily life in classical Athens, and the life he reveals is simultaneously more alien and more familiar than we might have imagined. From fish-guzzling gourmands to the ambiguous eroticism of vase paintings, the cradle of Western culture is artfully, and frequently amusingly, anatomized. Davidson believes that many historians, under the influence of Foucault, are guilty of imposing modern views of desire, and particularly sexuality, on Greek culture, resulting in a simplistic interpretation of what was an extremely complicated issue. He refutes the prevailing opinion that sex in Athens was a simple binary opposition of penetrator and penetrated, drawing on a remarkable number of sources to show how sexuality was a slippery commodity rooted in intricate social negotiations, a characteristic shared with many other objects of desire, from eels to undiluted wine. Davidson sometimes assumes a little too much knowledge on the part of his audience--some basic information about the size of the Athenian population would have been helpful--but in spite of this <i>Courtesans and Fishcakes</i> is both accessible and provocative, offering a fascinating portrait of the private and public lives of ancient Athenians. <i>--Simon Leake</i><p>&#x201c;A most enjoyable book about enjoyment.&#x201d;<br>PETER STOTHARD,'The Times'</p><p>&#x201c;James Davidson&#x2019;s concern is with ancient appetites: food, drink and sex in classical Athens. At one level, he provides a guided tour from bordello to Billingsgate; at another, an essay on the politics of consumption. Fish did loom large: it was the gourmet food, and therefore the social indicator. Literary critics found it extraordinary that the heroes of the Iliad lived on kebabs, though they were camped near the rich fishing grounds of the Dardanelles. This is a book of many pleasures, both in analysis and in anecdote. You can meet heroes of hedonism and martyrs of sensuality: Melanthios, who prayed for a neck like a heron&#x2019;s, so that he could linger long on the delicious mouthfuls; Philoxenos, who consumed a three foot octopus (except for the head), and nearly died of dyspepsia; the anonymous alcoholic immortalised by Aristotle, who put eggs under his mat and sat on them and drank continuously until they hatched. Davidson presents a superior class of hedonist ... His invigorating book paints the scene with polished scholarship and fine Hellenic gusto.&#x201d;<br>PETER PARSONS'London Review of Books'</p><p>&#x201c;Davidson blows away a whole heap of cobwebs, and at the same time shows up with merciless clarity the dissimulation and hypocrisy at the heart of some modern attitudes. We learn about where tarts took their clients, their tarifs and repertoire of sexual positions (the one called &#x2018;lion on the cheesegrater&#x2019; is a puzzler); about the quaint games of kottabos (flicking the remains of one&#x2019;s wine at a target) and quail tapping (you rapped a quail on the head and bet on whether it stood its ground or backed off); about the price of fresh eels and barracuda; about plonk and best vintage Chian wine.

But in 1962, Justice Arthur Goldberg and his clerk Alan Dershowitz dared to suggest otherwise, launching an underfunded band of civil rights attorneys on a quixotic crusade. In 1972, in a most unlikely victory, the Supreme Court struck down Georgia&#x2019;s death penalty law in <em>Furman v. Georgia</em>. Though the decision had sharply divided the justices, nearly everyone, including the justices themselves, believed <em>Furman</em> would mean the end of executions in America. <p>Instead, states responded with a swift and decisive showing of support for capital punishment. As anxiety about crime rose and public approval of the Supreme Court declined, the stage was set in 1976 for <em>Gregg v. Georgia</em>, in which the Court dramatically reversed direction.</p><p><em>A Wild Justice</em> is an extraordinary behind-the-scenes look at the Court, the justices, and the political complexities of one of the most racially charged and morally vexing issues of our time.</p> 8 pages of photographs</p><p>Evan J. Mandery is a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. A former capital defense attorney, he is the author of five previous books.

Unlike Bob Woodward&#x2019;s <em>The Brethren</em> and Jeffrey Toobin&#x2019;s <em>The Nine</em>, it shows how all the court players (politicians, clerks, litigants) had a part in its capital punishment decisions.... As much a sociological study as a discussion of the law, this volume is well written and illuminating.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Harry Charles, <em>Library Journal, starred review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;If someone described a book about the Supreme Court&#x2019;s decisions to strike down and then reinstate the death penalty as thrilling, would you believe her? You should; that&#x2019;s exactly what <em>A Wild Justice</em> is. Reading it, you get swept up in the details of the court cases that determined capital punishment&#x2019;s upheaval and rapid resurrection over the course of two decades.

Not so much a spinoff or a reboot, <i>Edge of Dawn</i> is the evolution of the series. It&#x2019;s also a good starting point for new readers who may not be familiar with the books that came before it. In the first ten books of the series, the existence of vampires (the Breed, as they&#x2019;re known here) has been undiscovered for many centuries. Now, in <i>Edge of Dawn</i>, the Breed has been outed to mankind in the worst way, exposed as blood-thirsting monsters to be feared and, if possible, destroyed. A tentative, tenuous peace has been found in the twenty years since, but there are those on both sides of the conflict who would like nothing more than to see that fragile truce dissolve into war.</p> <p>As a writer, I love romances that are set against a backdrop of deep external conflict and emotional drama. Add to that a pairing between two strong characters with their own unresolved history&#x2014;better yet, an undiscovered betrayal--and I&#x2019;m in storytelling heaven! In<i>Edge of Dawn</i>, long-time <i>Midnight Breed</i> readers will be reintroduced to Mira, a little girl in the first arc of the series, who is now the formidable captain of her own team of Breed warriors. As the book opens, Mira&#x2019;s young heart has been crushed by the war that claimed the only man she&#x2019;s ever loved. But she soon finds out the only thing that cuts deeper than a blade raised in combat is the sharp edge of a lie from someone she trusted above all others. . . .</p> <p>When I first began writing the Midnight Breed series eight years ago, I never dreamed it would go from the germ of an idea to an eleven-book (and counting!) best-selling series. If I&#x2019;d had any inclination of what I was getting myself into creatively, I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;d have had the guts to attempt it. </p> <p>You see, I&#x2019;m a plotting writer. I like to know where I&#x2019;m heading, and where I need to end up, before I write the first page. Sure, I allow for serendipity and surprises that spring organically from my characters and their interaction in the story. As a writer, you have to allow for those moments, or run the risk of crafting tightly woven stories with no heart or soul. Sometimes--in fiction and in real life--you need to take a leap of faith and see where you land.</p> <p>Taking a long-running, popular series in a new direction (not so new that fans won't recognize it) was a little scary, but at the same time, I've never had more fun with the series than I'm having now. There's still plenty of page-time with the familiar cast of characters from the Order, but in <i>Edge of Dawn</i> you'll be getting to know the next generation of warriors--all grown up--and their soon-to-be mates. You'll also meet some all-new characters I hope you'll love, and a few I think you'll probably love to hate.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy <i>Edge of Dawn</i> and the rest of the books in the Midnight Breed series.</p><b>The Midnight Breed Series reading order:</b><br> Book 0.5: A Touch of Midnight (prequel novella - free ebook)<br> Book 1: Kiss of Midnight<br> Book 2: Kiss of Crimson<br> Book 3: Midnight Awakening<br> Book 4: Midnight Rising<br> Book 5: Veil of Midnight<br> Book 6: Ashes of Midnight<br> Book 7: Shades of Midnight<br> Book 8: Taken by Midnight<br> Book 9: Deeper Than Midnight<br> Book 9.5: A Taste of Midnight (novella, ebook only)<br> Book 10: Darker After Midnight<br> The Midnight Breed Series Companion<br> Book 11: Edge of Dawn<br> Book 11.5: Marked by Midnight (novella)<br> Book 12: Crave the Night<br> Book 12.5: Tempted by Midnight (novella)<br> Book 13: Bound to Darkness (Spring 2015)<br> Book 13.5: Stroke of Midnight (novella, Oct 2015)<br> <b>...and more to come!</b><br><br> Also by Lara Adrian:<br> <b>Phoenix Code Romantic Suspense Series (with Tina Folsom)</b><br> Books 1 &amp; 2: Cut and Run<br> Books 3 &amp; 4: Hide and Seek (June 22, 2015)<br><br> <b>Masters of Seduction Paranormal Romance Series</b><br> Merciless: House of Gravori (in Masters of Seduction Vol 1)<br> Priceless: House of Ebarron (in Masters of Seduction Vol 2)<br><br> To get notified of new releases and to be eligible for subscribers-only giveaways and exclusive content, be sure to visit Lara's website and sign up for the newsletter!</p><h2>The Chimaera (Monsters of Mythology)</h2><p>Young hero Bellerophon sets out to conquer the fire-breathing chimera and win the hand of Queen Anteia</p><p></p><h2>The Devil's General: The Life of Hyazinth Graf von Strachwitz, &#x201c;The Panzer Graf&#x201d;</h2><p>This is the story of the most highly decorated German regimental commander of World War II, known as the &#x201c;Panzer Graf&#x201d; (Armored Count).

It sounds so uptight. I bet you hate Debbie. I hate Debbie, too.</i></p><p><i>Jack calls you Deb.</i></p><p><i>This is a letter about Jack.</i></p><p><i>I began sleeping with your husband last June. We were together for seven months, almost as long as I&#x2019;ve known him.</i></p><p><i>We did it in my apartment. Or I went to his studio, a lot. One time at the Comfort Inn in midtown, last August. He used his Visa. Look it up. I know about Kay, her getting bullied at school, and I know about when Simon got caught shoplifting at the Best Buy. I never asked to know about your family. It&#x2019;s just that sometimes, he needed me.</i></p><p><i>In movies, when the woman is dumped, one thing to do is to take all the love letters and pictures from photo booths and old T-shirts, and to set them on fire. This is to help the woman move on.</i></p><p><i>I don&#x2019;t have any pictures from photo booths. What I have is email, and a little blue folder on my hard drive called &#x201c;Chats.&#x201d; So, look what I did. I printed them, at a FedEx on Houston Street. $87.62. I haven&#x2019;t had my own printer since college. The hours and hours made pages and pages, none of it so romantic, a lot dirtier than I remembered. I bought a handle of Georgi at the liquor store so it would really burn&#x2014;the Jamaican behind the register gave me extra bags because it was hard to keep the pages together&#x2014;and I carried everything back, the sum of my love rolled in black-and-gold plastic, and dumped it all out into the bathtub.</i></p><p><i>But it didn&#x2019;t seem fair, that I should be left with the mess, when I use this tub, when I stand in it almost every day. So I got this box together, to give to him.</i></p><p><i>And then just now I was looking at it, and I realized whom I should be giving it to. You.</i></p><p><i>Falling in love is just an excuse for bad behavior. If you&#x2019;re fucking someone in a way that you mean it, the rest of you is fucked also. Did I care about you, your children? Did I care about my work? Ask me if I cared. If I care, even.</i></p><p><i>The thing that kills me, that I can&#x2019;t get over, is I didn&#x2019;t do anything to make him stop wanting me. I didn&#x2019;t change. I held very still on purpose. I weighed myself the other day for the first time in a long time. I thought for sure I&#x2019;d gained weight, like twenty pounds. Twenty pounds is maybe enough to change the way someone feels about you. But no.</i></p><p><i>You get migraines, right? He told me you do. I get them too, Deb. Do you think maybe it&#x2019;s him? That the migraines are coming from him? Like if we drank the same dirty water and got cancer, or if we both lived a block from 9/11 and got cancer, or if we did anything the same and got cancer, then we&#x2019;d trace it to the source, right, and expect a settlement, wouldn&#x2019;t we. What are you settling for, Deb? How much did you get?<br></i><br><br></p><p> There were things you learned early, growing up in the city, and there were things you learned late, or not at all. Bicycles were one of the things Kay had missed, along with tree swings and car pools, dishwashers and game rooms in the basement. The only style of swimming Kay knew was the style of not drowning, any direction but down. Instead of a dog, they had a cat, and before that a cockatiel and a cockatoo, sea monkeys, lizards, gerbils that made more gerbils, one regrettable guinea pig.</p><p>She made up for what she&#x2019;d missed with things New York had taught her. Like how long you had to walk after the DON&#x2019;T WALK started to blink. The way to hail a cab (hand out but still, fingers together). She knew where to stand in an elevator depending on how many people were on it already, when to hold the poles on the subway and when it was okay just to let go and glide. She knew how to be surrounded by people and not meet anybody&#x2019;s eye.</p><p>&#x201c;If you push harder, you won&#x2019;t shake so much.&#x201d; That was what the other girls all said. They kept a few yards away, pigeon-toed, with hands on their hips or as visors over their foreheads. It was the Sunday morning after a sleepover. Their eyes worked at pinching out the sun.</p><p>&#x201c;Just bike to here, Kay.&#x201d; Racky, on the only other bike, made figure eights around the rest of them, Chelsea and the Haber twins with their twin braids. It had become a group project at these New Rochelle playdates, teaching Kay to ride. She could never get past the wobbly, the fear of falling. That jelly feeling would hit after the first pump, and her foot would come down like a gag reflex, like the time she smacked the wooden stick out of Dr. Frankel&#x2019;s hand when he tried to depress her tongue with it, her foot would hit the pavement and drag her to a stop. Cycle, stop. Cycle, stop. Twenty minutes of this, most weekends, and finally the others would get bored, would propose trips to the multiplex, to TCBY, to the kitchen for facials with an issue of <i>Allure</i> and someone&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s old avocado.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; It was a hot day and probably there was something good on TV, in the air-conditioning. Central air seemed the greatest of suburban luxuries. It was like living inside a Duane Reade. They had AC units at home, wheezy ones that dripped puddles under the windowsills.</p><p>&#x201c;If Kay bikes to here,&#x201d; Racky said, &#x201c;she can choose what movie we watch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to choose what movie.&#x201d;</p><p>The girls whispered, negotiating behind long strings of blonde that they tucked behind their ears as they came up with new terms.</p><p>&#x201c;If Kay bikes to here,&#x201d; said one of the twins, &#x201c;she can choose the movie <i>and</i> if we get pizza or Chinese.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what we eat.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Lo mein, Kay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>Racky rang the bell on her handlebar. &#x201c;If she bikes to here,&#x201d; she said, counting off on her fingers, &#x201c;she gets the movie, Chinese, <i>and</i> twenty bucks.&#x201d;</p><p>The Haber twins laughed. Kay understood that no one expected her to make it, that they were already telling the story on Monday in the cafeteria, the great lengths they had gone to teach Kay, how hopeless she was.</p><p>She pushed off the pavement with the girls still laughing and forced herself to pedal a second time, through the uneasiness. For once, she wasn&#x2019;t afraid to fall. If she fell, then at least this all would be over; they&#x2019;d stop laughing, maybe even feel bad.</p><p>She rode right past them&#x2014;past them!&#x2014;went another eight or nine yards before sailing into a curb. But still, she had done it. Been bullied into it, but still.</p><p>She chose <i>Harry Potter</i> and beef lo mein. She never did get the twenty dollars from Racky, but then she never asked.<br>It was half past nine by the time Racky&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s minivan pulled up in front of Kay&#x2019;s apartment building. &#x201c;Your mother&#x2019;s going to have me arrested for kidnapping.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She won&#x2019;t care.&#x201d; Sometimes Kay caught herself making her mother sound neglectful for no reason. She said thanks, for the ride or the weekend generally, to the whole of the car and worked the handle to slide herself out. She could feel the minivan waiting for her to reach the lobby before it lurched away.</p><p>Kay&#x2019;s favorite doorman was on. She never called him by his name, although she knew it, had heard other people address him this way. She was afraid that in her mouth it would come out wrong, that she&#x2019;d been mishearing it all this time&#x2014;what everyone else was saying <i>sounded</i> like Angel, but no one was named Angel.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, Kay,&#x201d; he said when she came shuffling through the lobby, backpack heavy with weekend things. She got to the elevator door just as it opened, and inside her button was pushed already. A magic trick Angel liked to perform. Kay stuck her head out to gape at him, as always, the suggestion of applause, and Angel laughed high and long, different from his laugh with the adults.</p><p>The door was sliding shut when Angel held up a finger&#x2014; wait&#x2014;and ran around to the service elevator where they kept the packages. He came back with a box.</p><p>&#x201c;For Mommy,&#x201d; Angel said.</p><p>Riding up in the elevator, she turned the box around in her arms. Its flaps were tucked instead of taped together, and there wasn&#x2019;t any postage or even a street address. And another thing: It was addressed, in black Sharpie, to Mrs. Jack Shanley. No one called her mother that except for Kay&#x2019;s grandparents, her father&#x2019;s mother.</p><p>In the light of the hall, she noticed something pink where the flaps left an opening. The one thing she would not confess to after that night, for which she would always feel a flush of shame, was the thought that inside the box was a present for her.</p><p>Her birthday was not until September, and they observed Easter only in candy aisles the day after. However. If it was a gift for her, she didn&#x2019;t want to wait until the fall to get it, and if it was for her mother, or her father, or for Simon, then there wasn&#x2019;t any harm checking.</p><p>Inside, it was just paper. So many pieces of paper, thrown together like tickets in a raffle.</p><p><i>i went to that dinner party in red hook tonight. all the talk was about what&#x2019;s happening in syria, what&#x2019;s happening in egypt, and i can only think about what&#x2019;s happening with you.</i></p><p>The feeling that her domino eyes were running over something she wasn&#x2019;t supposed to see. She tried to make them stop, or to see without reading, but they could not, would not stop.</p><p><i>i can&#x2019;t explain why i get so sad when you make me so happy</i></p><p><i>i&#x2019;ve been thinking of how you pressed my hand against your neck</i></p><p><i>show me your cunt</i></p><p>And right there, slid off the top, the winning ticket, the pink that had drawn her in: an envelope. This, too, was addressed to her mother, but it wasn&#x2019;t sealed, and so she opened it. The letter was the only thing in the box that had been written by hand.</p><p><i>Dear Deborah,</i></p><p>And:</p><p><i>I began sleeping with your husband last June.</i></p><p>And:</p><p><i>I know about Kay.</i></p><p>She redid the flaps, held the box under her arm, and let herself into the apartment. Clenching all her parts as she passed her mother and brother in front of the television.</p><p>&#x201c;Kay?&#x201d; her mother called. &#x201c;Why so late?&#x201d;</p><p>Quickly to her room, head down to hide her face. There was that little guy in her throat, the one that hurt when she wanted to cry.</p><p>Her mother&#x2019;s shoes clicking nearer, she buried the box under a tangle of shirtsleeves on the floor of her closet just as the door swung open. &#x201c;Babe? What happened to you? I tried Arlene.&#x201d; Kay pretended to look for something in her bottom dresser drawer. &#x201c;She never picks up. I don&#x2019;t like that woman.&#x201d; Kay was moving handfuls of clothes from one end of the drawer to the other. &#x201c;Did you hear me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a good mom.&#x201d; She hadn&#x2019;t meant to defend Racky&#x2019;s mother. Feeling herself start to cry, she dug deeper into the drawer. Nightgown. Where was her yellow nightgown?</p><p>&#x201c;Baby, did something happen?&#x201d; Deb&#x2019;s hand touched her shoulder and Kay twisted away. Her mother was quiet and so pretty, with her shiny hair and tiny waist, the evenness and natural tan of skin that Kay had not gotten from her. &#x201c;Did you have a hard time with the girls, with learning the bike?&#x201d;</p><p>The bike, the sleepover, those things seemed small and far away now, but remembering made everything worse: yet another place where her life was not as she wanted it to be: She had unkind friends. But in a way it was good to remember, it allowed for her tears. Her mother held her, and she let herself be held, in the orb of Deb&#x2019;s Deb-scented perfume.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you fall?&#x201d;</p><p>Kay nodded. The wet skin under her eye stuck to her mother&#x2019;s arm.</p><p>&#x201c;Where does it hurt?&#x201d;</p><p>She could follow instructions and give the box to her mother. She could throw it away. She could give it back to Angel, have <i>him</i> throw it away. What she couldn&#x2019;t do, she knew in that moment, was go to her father, who might never tell her mother, if he had the box, because how could she live with him then.</p><p>For now the safest thing to do was nothing. The box was a secret she kept, the whole next day at school. She found herself in history, in math, in science, not knowing how she got there, not remembering the halls. Lockers slammed too loud, and Racky, the twins, everyone was always laughing about something, and what was so fucking funny all the time? She felt faraway and alien, her teachers going on about fractions and photosynthesis and the Underground Railroad. What did these things have to do with her life, where did they touch her?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> It wasn&#x2019;t Sunday but Monday that everything happened, and Simon might have been slightly, vaguely, barely, just approximately high. A little tiny bit.</p><p>He&#x2019;d skipped the bus home and gone to the Short Stop diner down the hill from school, where the kids sat drinking bottomless cups of coffee with their omelets and buttered toast, tired-eyed teenagers who hibernated through breakfast every morning and so made up for it in the afternoons, ruining the dinners their mothers or housekeepers were making for them at home. Seniors held court over the seven booths, leaving the underclassmen to share barstools, cheek to cheek. Simon was fifteen but arrived with a senior from his religion class, Jared Berkoff, with whom he&#x2019;d been partnered to present on Confucianism, a topic they&#x2019;d drawn at random from Mr. Dionisio&#x2019;s just-rinsed, still-damp coffee tumbler. Jared was a stoner, always high except on the social ladder, though the JAPs still invited him to their parties, and when one of the more inspired jocks discovered the effect of switching out a letter in Berkoff, a mascot was born. There were worse people for Simon to show up with. The diner was where deals were struck, where everyone went looking for drugs or for play. Jared was looking to score both.</p><p>Both arrived in the shape of Elena Gorbunova, a junior with a broad forehead and pretty, space-alien eyes. Simon had seen her before in the cafeteria, knew the tight turtlenecks that hugged her so that waist-up she might have been a figure skater.</p><p>&#x201c;Gorbunova,&#x201d; Jared said, flipping shut his phone. Clearly she was the one he&#x2019;d been texting since they sat down in the back booth, next to a quiet senior who did studio art and whose cuffs and cuticles were always edged with paint. &#x201c;Gorbunova&#x2019;s going to smoke us out.&#x201d;</p><p>Elena, with the slightest bend of her knee, managed to curtsy. Probably she and Jared had something&#x2014;or used to have something or were about to have something&#x2014;going on. She led them out the door, all hip bone, tonguing a sugar packet.</p><p>Elena got a steady supply of weed from her brother, Gorb, now a student at Manhattan College, which was in the Bronx, near their school. Gorb had been expelled from high school his sophomore year, but before that he&#x2019;d been a star of the varsity fencing team, which practiced in the middle school gym. Simon remembered him, padded white and huge, like a walking sofa bed, with a wispy mustache and a silver mask under his arm, whipping a foil around the breezeway.</p><p>In the parking lot beside a shuttered tanning salon, the three of them squatted behind a car, and Elena set a yellow glass bowl on the ground. She pulled the weed apart, packed it herself. Sticky on her fingers, but she worked fast. She might have been failing out of PE, but clearly there were things she kne...</p></p><h2>Before I Forget: Fifty Years of Muskie Fishing</h2><p>Three Thousand Six Hundred and Ninety-Six Muskies! Len Hartman never wanted to be president of General Motors, and you never found Betty in a parade carrying a banner for women&#39;s lib. The two of them just wanted to be the greatest muskie-fishing pair of their time. And they were! For half a century they explord the St. Lawrence River, Georgian Bay, The Manitou, Kentucy&#39;s famous Dale Hollow, Minnesota&#39;s explosive Leech Lake, the muskie-rich waters of Wisconsin... and countless places in between. Together they cought almost four thousand muskies (over four tons!), and released over 98% of them. Today, they still list seven of the top twenty-two muskies of all time. In this book, Len tells where, when, why and how they did it... and how they view the future of their favorite sport: muskie fishing.</p><p></p><h2>Matters of Fact and of Fiction (Essays 1973-1976)</h2><p>The outspoken novelist and critic trains his sometimes controversial sights on present-day fiction, writers of note or notoriety, and fashionable literary attitudes and on historical and political topics of current interest</p><p></p><h2>All I Ever Need Is You (The Sullivans)</h2><p>Seattle architect Adam Sullivan is well known for his brilliant historic building restorations&#x2014;and for having absolutely no interest in love and marriage.

Is evolution &#34;just a theory&#34;? Is autism caused by vaccinations? The answer to all of these questions is, of course, no. The scientific evidence is now in, and it&#39;s conclusive, on these and many more issues that are fundamental to our knowledge and wellbeing. But you&#39;d never know this if all of your information came from the popular media or your upbringing and immediate circle of influence didn&#39;t include critical thinking and basic scientific literacy.As this witty book with a very serious message shows, our culture has in recent decades been characterized by a widespread antagonism toward science and the not-always-welcome messages it brings. Large sections of the supposedly sophisticated populations in the developed nations are in an active state of denial. Not only do they deny scientific evidence but they also call into question the very competence of science as a descriptor of reality. In short, they deny reality. The author surveys the gamut of clearly unscientific ideas concerning the food we eat, the medicines and potions we are either afraid of or advised to take, our sex preferences, and a host of other issues that are raised by various panics, urban legends, and a general climate of misinformation. He also examines how special interests, from agribusiness to pharmaceutical companies to creationists, actively work to distort or suppress scientific findings. While the tendency may be to laugh at some of the ridiculous notions catalogued in the author&#39;s overview of bogus ideas, the overall picture he creates is anything but funny. This book reminds the reader that the future of free, increasingly complex societies depends on an educated citizenry that is able to think clearly and critically based on reliable information.</p><p><b>John Grant</b> is the author of more than seventy books, including the critically acclaimed <i>Discarded Science, Corrupted Science</i>, and<i> Bogus Science</i>.

These nomadic peoples from central Asia briefly held sway over an empire that stretched across Asia to the frontiers of Germany and the shores of the Adriatic. Surprisingly little has been written on this vast and immensely influential empire, known chiefly through the charismatic leaders, Chingis Khan and Kublai Khan.</p><p>J. J. Saunders's landmark book, first published in 1972, is a carefully documented introductory history of the rise and fall of the great Mongol empire. Saunders sets the historical stage with a discussion of nomad groups and cultures at the dawn of the second millennium, and then traces the rise of the Mongol conquests through the earlier Turkish expansion into Asia between the eighth and twelfth centuries. Beginning in the early 1200s, the Mongols led by Chingis Khan began their insatiable assault on all the kingdoms and peoples around them, erasing whole cities, killing entire populations, forcing mass migrations, and permanently changing the distribution of the world's major religions. The Mongols were finally checked along the edges of Europe and forced out of the Middle East by rejuvenated Muslim factions.</p><p>As Saunders concludes, one of the major legacies of the Mongol conquests was the transfer of intellectual and scientific primacy of the Old World from Islamic societies to Western Europe, paving the way for the Renaissance.</p></p><p>J. J. Saunders was Reader in History at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.

Now at last, Dave Duffey, Dog Editor of Outdoor Life, has filled this void with a book that provides solid factual information where it can be established, and plausible speculation based on broad practical experience where the truth is unverifiable, about the whole range of America&#39; sight and scent hounds from the familiar beagle, fox and coonhound to the specialist hunters after lion, bear and boar.

DuBois as their model, two of America&#39;s foremost African-American intellectuals address the dreams, fears, aspirations, and responsibilities of the black community--especially the black elite--on the eve of the 21st century.</p><p>Henry Louis Gates, Jr. is W. E. B. Du Bois Professor of the Humanities and chair of the Department of Afro-American Studies at Harvard University.Two of our most prominent and eloquent black intellectuals confront the challenge of W.E.B. DuBois and the notion of the ``Talented Tenth'' as it applies to themselves and other African-American thinkers at the end of the 20th century. In a 1903 essay, DuBois outlined what he saw as the responsibility of the most fortunate, gifted, and successful minds in the black community to ``uplift the race.'' Over 90 years later, Gates (Colored People, 1994, etc.) and West (Race Matters, 1993, etc.) are perhaps the embodiment of that exalted group. In the two essays that make up the bulk of this slender but important volume (which also includes DuBois's original essay), they examine that sense of responsibility in light of the past half-century of rapid change. Gates points out that the growing African-American middle class has become more uncoupled than ever from its impoverished inner-city kin. Gates writes elegantly of the sense of guilt that intellectuals carry in the face of this social phenomenon: ``If your name is Auchincloss, say, you do not worry overmuch about those impoverished Appalachians who share your Scottish descent; few blacks have the luxury of such detachment.'' West, by contrast, confronts the ghost of DuBois head-on, finding the concept of the Talented Tenth ``inadequate,'' a naive faith in the power of education to transform the polity. Where this will lead is impossible for either writer to say, but Gates is on the money when he writes, ``We need something we don't yet have: a way of speaking about black poverty that doesn't falsify the reality of black advancement; a way of speaking about black advancement that doesn't distort the enduring realities of black poverty.'' Thoughtful and, particularly in the Gates essay, deeply felt. A useful introduction to important contemporary thinkers and the question that has plagued African-American intellectuals for over 200 years. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

With wit and humor, Gross details recommended strategies, revealing where the markets are headed--and how to ride them to success.</p><p><i>Everything You've Heard About Investing Is Wrong!,</i> by respected money manager (and one-time professional blackjack player) William H. Gross, bucks traditional wisdom by predicting that stocks and bonds will average returns of just 6 percent over the next decade. In terms understandable to novice and experienced investors alike, it then suggests ways to maximize profits during this post-bull period. Liberally sprinkled with personal anecdotes, this is a surprisingly entertaining and thought-provoking book.Among those who believe that the persistent slide of the Dow Jones is marking the end of a 20-year bull market bonanza and the beginning of a new era of lower returns on equities is bond-market authority Gross, cofounder and chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Company. Using vignettes from his personal life to impart his investment philosophy, Gross makes his case that bonds will be the choice investment in the future. He argues successfully that bonds will have a distinct advantage in the coming era of low inflation and offers a good chapter on the benefits of inflation-indexed Treasury bonds that will be of interest for those looking for inflationary hedges. While he unearths nothing new, Gross's work offers a unique perspective and a compelling argument for investing in bonds in the postbull market.

Natasha arranged a velvet-gowned doll in a child-sized bentwood rocker before she turned to her assistant."Okay, Annie, what great-looking man are we talking about in particular?"<br><br>"The tall, blond and gorgeous one who's standing outside the shop window with his nifty-looking wife and beautiful little girl." Annie tucked a wad of gum into her cheek and heaved a gusty sigh. "They look like an ad for Perfect Family Digest."<br><br>"Then perhaps they'll come in and buy the perfect toy."<br><br>Natasha stepped back from her grouping of Victorian dolls and accessories with a nod of approval. It looked exactly as she wanted&#x2014;appealing, elegant and old-fashioned. She checked everything down to the tasseled fan in a tiny, china hand.<br><br>The toy store wasn't just her business, it was her greatest pleasure. Everything from the smallest rattle to the biggest stuffed bear was chosen by her with the same eye for detail and quality. She insisted on the best for her shop and her customers, whether it was a five-hundred-dollar doll with its own fur wrap or a two-dollar, palm-sized race car.When the match was right, she was pleased to ring up either sale.<br><br>In the three years since she had opened her jingling front door, Natasha had made The Fun House one of the most thriving concerns in the small college town on the West Virginia border. It had taken drive and persistence, but her success was more a direct result of her innate understanding of children. She didn't want her clients to walk out with a toy. She wanted them to walk out with the right toy.<br><br>Deciding to make a few adjustments, Natasha moved over to a display of miniature cars.<br><br>"I think they're going to come in," Annie was saying as she smoothed down her short crop of auburn hair. "The little girl's practically bouncing out of her Mary Janes.Want me to open up?"<br><br>Always precise, Natasha glanced at the grinning clown clock overhead. "We have five minutes yet."<br><br>"What's five minutes? Tash, I'm telling you this guy is incredible." Wanting a closer look, Annie edged down an aisle to restack board games. "Oh, yes. Six foot two, a hundred and sixty pounds.The best shoulders I've ever seen fill out a suit jacket. Oh Lord, it's tweed. I didn't know a guy in tweed could make me salivate."<br><br>"A man in cardboard can make you salivate."<br><br>"Most of the guys I know are cardboard." A dimple winked at the corner of Annie's mouth. She peeked around the counter of wooden toys to see if he was still at the window. "He must have spent some time at the beach this summer. His hair's sun-streaked and he's got a fabulous tan. Oh, God, he smiled at the little girl. I think I'm in love."<br><br>Choreographing a scaled-down traffic jam, Natasha smiled. "You always think you're in love." <br><br>"I know." Annie sighed. "I wish I could see the color of his eyes. He's got one of those wonderfully lean and bony faces. I'm sure he's incredibly intelligent and has suffered horribly."<br><br>Natasha shot a quick, amused look over her shoulder.Annie, with her tall, skinny build had a heart as soft as marshmallow cream. "I'm sure his wife would be fascinated with your fantasy."<br><br>"It's a woman's privilege&#x2014;no, her obligation&#x2014;to weave fantasies over men like that."<br><br>Though she couldn't have disagreed more, Natasha let Annie have her way. "All right then. Go ahead and open up."<br><br>"One doll," Spence said, giving his daughter's ear a tug. "I might have thought twice about moving into that house, if I'd realized there was a toy store a half mile away."<br><br>"You'd buy her the bloody toy store if you had your way." <br><br>He spared one glance for the woman beside him."Don't start,Nina." <br><br>The slender blonde shrugged her shoulders, rippling the trim, rose linen jacket of her suit, then looked at the little girl."I just meant your daddy tends to spoil you because he loves you so much. Besides, you deserve a present for being so good about the move."<br><br>Little Frederica Kimball's bottom lip pouted. "I like my new house." She slipped her hand into her father's, automatically aligning herself with him and against the world. "I have a yard and a swing set all of my own."<br><br>Nina looked them over, the tall, rangy man and the fairy-sized young girl. They had identical stubborn chins. As far as she could remember, she'd never won an argument with either one.<br><br>"I suppose I'm the only one who doesn't see that as an advantage over living in New York." Nina's tone warmed slightly as she stroked the girl's hair."I can't help worrying about you a little bit. I really only want you to be happy, darling.You and your daddy."<br><br>"We are." To break the tension, Spence swung Freddie into his arms. "Aren't we, funny face?"<br><br>"She's about to be that much happier." Relenting, Nina gave Spence's hand a squeeze. "They're opening."<br><br>"Good morning."They were gray,Annie noted, biting back a long, dreamy, "Ahh."A glorious gray. She tucked her little fantasy into the back of her mind and ushered in the first customers of the day. "May I help you?"<br><br>"My daughter's interested in a doll." Spence set Freddie on her feet again.<br><br>"Well, you've come to the right place." Annie dutifully switched her attention to the child. She really was a cute little thing, with her father's gray eyes and pale, flyaway blond hair. "What kind of doll would you like?"<br><br>"A pretty one," Freddie answered immediately."A pretty one with red hair and blue eyes."<br><br>"I'm sure we have just what you want." She offered a hand."Would you like to look around?"<br><br>After a glance at her father for approval, Freddie linked hands with Annie and wandered off.<br><br>"Damn it." Spence found himself wincing.<br><br>Nina squeezed his hand for the second time. "Spence&#x2014;"<br><br>"I delude myself thinking that it doesn't matter, that she doesn't even remember."<br><br>"Just because she wanted a doll with red hair and blue eyes doesn't mean anything."<br><br>"Red hair and blue eyes," he repeated; the frustration welled up once more. "Just like Angela's. She remembers, Nina. And it does matter." Stuffing his hands into his pockets he walked away.<br><br>Three years, he thought. It had been nearly three years now. Freddie had still been in diapers. But she remembered Angela&#x2014;beautiful, careless Angela. Not even the most liberal critic would have considered Angela a mother. She had never cuddled or crooned, never rocked or soothed.<br><br>He studied a small, porcelain-faced doll dressed in pale, angelic blue.Tiny, tapering fingers, huge, dreamy eyes.Angela had been like that, he remembered. Ethereally beautiful.And cold as glass.<br><br>He had loved her as a man might love a piece of art&#x2014;distantly admiring the perfection of form, and constantly searching for the meaning beneath it. Between them they had somehow created a warm, gorgeous child who had managed to find her way through the first years of her life almost without help from her parents.<br><br>But he would make it up to her. Spence shut his eyes for a moment. He intended to do everything in his power to give his daughter the love, the structure and the security she deserved.The realness.The word seemed trite, but it was the only one he could find that described what he wanted for his daughter&#x2014;the real, the solid bond of family.<br><br>She loved him. He felt some of the tension ease from his shoulders as he thought of the way Freddie's big eyes would shine when he tucked her in at night, at the way her arms would wrap tightly around him when he held her. Perhaps he would never fully forgive himself for being so involved with his own problems, his own life during her infancy, but things had changed. Even this move had been made with her welfare in mind.<br><br>He heard her laugh, and the rest of the tension dissolved on a wave of pure pleasure. There was no sweeter music than his little girl's laugh.An entire symphony could be written around it. He wouldn't disturb her yet, Spence thought. Let her indulge herself with the bright and beautiful dolls, before he had to remind her that only one could be hers.<br><br>Relaxed again, he began to pay attention to the shop. Like the dolls he'd imagined for his daughter, it was bright and beautiful. Though small, it was packed from wall to wall with everything a child might covet. A big golden giraffe and a sad-eyed purple dog hung from the ceiling. Wooden trains, cars and planes, all painted in bold colors, jockeyed for position on a long display table with elegant miniature furniture. An old-fashioned jack-in-the-box sat beside an intricate scale model of a futuristic space station. There were dolls, some beautiful, some charmingly homely, erector sets and tea sets.<br><br>The lack of studied arrangement made the result all the more appealing.This was a place to pretend and to wish, a crowded Aladdin's cave designed to make children's eyes light in wonder.To make them laugh, as his daughter was laughing now. He could already foresee that he'd be hard-pressed to keep Freddie from making regular visits.<br><br>That was one of the reasons he'd made the move to a small town. He wanted his daughter to be able to reap the pleasures of local shops, where the merchants would know her name. She would be able to walk from one end of town to the other without those big-city worries about muggings, abductions and drugs.There would be no need for dead bolts and security systems, for "white noise" machines to block out the surge and grind of traffic. Even a girl as little as his Freddie wouldn't be swallowed up here.<br><br>And perhaps, without the pace and the pressure, he would make peace with himself.<br><br>Idly he picked up a music box. It was of delicately crafted porcelain, graced with a figure of a raven-haired Gypsy woman in a flounced red dress. In her ears were tiny gold loops, and in her hands a tambourine with colored streamers. He was certain he wouldn't have found anything more skillfully made on Fifth Avenue.<br><br>He wondered how the owner could leave it out where small, curious fingers might reach and break. Intrigued, he turned the key and watched the figure revolve around the tiny, china camp fire.<br><br>Tchaikovsky. He recognized the movement instantly, and his skilled ear approved the quality of tone.A moody, even passionate piece, he thought, finding it strange to come across such exquisite workmanship in a toy store.Then he glanced up and saw Natasha.<br><br>He stared. He couldn't help it. She was standing a few feet away, her head up, slightly tilted as she watched him. Her hair was as dark as the dancer's and corkscrewed around her face in a wild disarray that flowed beyond her shoulders. Her skin was a dark, rich gold that was set off by the simple red dress she wore.<br><br>But this woman was not fragile, he thought.Though she was small, he got the impression of power. Perhaps it was her face, with its full, unpainted mouth and high, slashing cheekbones. Her eyes were almost as dark as her hair, heavy-lidded and thickly lashed. Even from a distance of ten feet he sensed it. Strong, undiluted sex. It surrounded her as other women surrounded themselves with perfumes.<br><br>For the first time in years he felt the muscle-numbing heat of pure desire.<br><br>Natasha saw it, then recognized and resented it.What kind of man, she wondered, walked into a room with his wife and daughter, then looked at another woman with naked hunger in his eyes?<br><br>Not her kind.<br><br>Determined to ignore the look as she had ignored it from others in the past, she crossed to him. "Do you need some help?"<br><br>Help? Spence thought blankly. He needed oxygen. He hadn't known it was literally possible for a woman to take a man's breath away. "Who are you?"<br><br>"Natasha Stanislaski."She offered her coolest smile."I own the store." <br><br>Her voice seemed to hang in the air, husky, vital, with a trace of her Slavic origins adding eroticism as truly as the music still playing behind him. She smelled of soap, nothing more, yet the fragrance completely seduced him.<br><br>When he didn't speak, she lifted a brow. It might have been amusing to knock a man off his feet, but she was busy at the moment, and the man was married. "Your daughter has her selection down to three dolls. Perhaps you'd like to help her with her final choice."<br><br>"In a minute.Your accent&#x2014;is it Russian?"<br><br>"Yes." She wondered if she should tell him his wife was standing near the front door, bored and impatient.<br><br>"How long have you been in America?"<br><br>"Since I was six." She aimed a deliberately cold glance. "About the same age as your little girl. Excuse me&#x2014;"<br><br>He had his hand on her arm before he could stop himself. Even though he knew the move was a bad one, the venom in her eyes surprised him. "Sorry. I was going to ask you about this music box."<br><br>Natasha shifted her gaze to it as the music began to wind down. "It's one of our best, handcrafted here in the States. Are you interested in buying it?"<br><br>"I haven't decided, but I thought you might not have realized it was sitting out on that shelf."<br><br>"Why?" <br><br>"It's not the kind of merchandise one expects to find in a toy store. It could easily be broken."<br><br>Natasha took it and placed it farther back on the shelf. "And it can be mended." She made a quick, clearly habitual movement with her shoulders. It spoke of arrogance rather than carelessness. "I believe children should be allowed the pleasures of music, don't you?"<br><br>"Yes." For the first time a smile flickered over his face. It was, as Annie had noted, a particularly effective one, Natasha had to admit. Through her annoyance she felt the trickle of attraction, and strangely, kinship.Then he said,"As a matter of fact, I believe that quite strongly. Perhaps we could discuss it over dinner."<br><br>Holding herself rigid, Natasha battled back fury. It was difficult for one with her hot, often turbulent nature, but she reminded herself that the man had not only his wife, but his young daughter in the store.<br><br>The angry insults that rose to her throat were swallowed, but not before Spence saw them reflected in her eyes.<br><br>"No," was all she said as she turned.<br><br>"Miss&#x2014;" Spence began, then Freddie whirled down the aisle, carrying a big, floppy Raggedy Ann.<br><br>"Daddy, isn't she nice?" Eyes shining, she held out the doll for his approval.<br><br>It was redheaded, Spence thought. But it was anything but beautiful. Nor, to his relief, was it a symbol of Angela. Because he knew Freddie expected it, he took his time examining her choice."This is," he said after a moment, "the very best doll I've seen today."<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>He crouched until he was eye to eye with his daughter."Absolutely. You have excellent taste, funny face."<br><br>Freddie reached out, crushing the doll between them as she hugged her father. "I can have her?"<br><br>"I thought she was for me." As Freddie giggled, he picked up the pair of them.<br><br>"I'll be happy to wrap her for you." Natasha's tone was warmer, she knew. He might be a jerk, but he loved his daughter.<br><br>"I can carry her." Freddie squeezed her new friend close.<br><br>"All right.Then I'll just give you a ribbon for her hair.Would you like that?"<br><br>"A blue one."<br><br>"A blue one it is." Natasha led the way to the cash register.<br><br>Nina took one look at the doll and rolled her eyes."Darling, is that the best you could do?"<br><br>"Daddy likes her," Freddie murmured, ducking her head.<br><br>"Yes, I do. Very much," he added with a telling look for Nina. Setting Freddie on her feet again, he fished out his wallet.<br><br>The mother was certainly no prize, Natasha decided.Though that didn't give the man a right to come on to a clerk in a toy store. She made chang...</p><h2>Too Stuck to Move: How NOT to be a Vainglorious, Haughty, Arrogant, Patronizing, Immodest, Conceited, Egocentric, Condescending, Generationally ...

Old Money examines how and why the values nurtured by the inheritors of wealth differ from those of the marketplace and the self-made man, and shows how these differing attitudes toward money affect the lives of individuals and the face of society. Old Money attitudes are an inheritance of educational and aesthetic values, attitudes toward the family, the genders and different generations, as well. Drawing on personal experience, historical anecdotes of leading families like the Vanderbilts, Roosevelts, Kennedys, and Rockefellers, and more than 150 interviews, Old Money conducts a revealing exploration of the complex meanings of money and success in American society.

The essays in this volume offer a fresh insight into the emerging interdisciplinary research field of textile and dress studies by discussing archaeological, iconographical and textual evidence within a broad geographical and chronological spectrum. The thirteen chapters explore issues, such as the analysis of textile tools, especially spindle whorls, and textile imprints for reconstructing textile production in contexts as different as Neolithic Transylvania, the Early Bronze Age North Aegean and the Early Iron Age Eastern Mediterranean; the importance of cuneiform clay tablets as a documentary source for both drawing a detailed picture of the administration of a textile industry and for addressing gender issues, such as the construction of masculinity in the Sumerian kingdoms of the 3rd millennium BC; and discussions of royal and priestly costumes and clothing ornaments in the Mesopotamian kingdom of Mari and in Mycenaean culture. Textile terms testify to intensive exchanges between Semitic and Indo-European languages, especially within the terminology of trade goods. The production and consumption of textiles and garments are demonstrated in 2nd millennium Hittite Anatolia; from 1st millennium BC Assyria, a cross-disciplinary approach combines texts, realia and iconography to produce a systematic study of golden dress decorations; and finally, the important discussion of fibers, flax and wool, in written and archaeological sources is evidence for delineating the economy of linen and the strong symbolic value of fiber types in 1st millennium Babylonia and the Southern Levant. The volume is part of a pair together with Greek and Roman Textiles and Dress: An Interdisciplinary Anthology edited by Mary Harlow and Marie-Louise Nosch.

Although other visual artists, such as Salvador Dali and Yves Klein, had used live self-portraiture and performance as a vehicle for public provocation, Schneemann was among the first to use her body to animate the relationship between the world of lived experience and the imagination, as well as issues of the erotic, the sacred, and the taboo. In the 1960s, her work prefigured the feminist movement's sexual self-assertion for women, and by the mid-1970s, her work anticipated the field of women's studies and its critique of patriarchal institutions. In the 1980s, she was one of the first to experiment with virtual environments.<br> <br> <i>Imaging Her Erotics</i> integrates images from Schneemann's works in painting, collage, drawing, and video sculptures with written material drawn from the artist's journals, dream diaries, essays, and lectures. Encompassing four decades of her work, it demonstrates her profound influence on artists in all media. An opening essay by Kristine Stiles presents Schneemann's major themes and places her work in a historical context. Among other topics, the book covers Schneemann's response to the widespread use by artists of the ideas of theoreticians such as Georges Bataille, Jacques Derrida, and Jacques Lacan; her relationship to male artists such as Joseph Cornell, Robert Morris, and Claes Oldenburg; and reminiscences about her friends Ana Mendieta, Charlotte Moorman, and Hannah Wilke. The book also contains essays by Jay Murphy and David Levi-Strauss and interviews with the artist by Kate Haug, Linda Montano, and Aviva Rahmani.</p><p>Carolee Schneemann teaches in the MFA Program at Bard College. She is the winner of the Jimmy Ernst Award in Art presented by The American Academy of Arts and Letters. The $5000 prize is given to a &#34;painter or sculptor whose lifetime contribution to his or her vision has been both consistent and dedicated.&#34;From the perspective of today's art world, where "transgression" has become for many little more then a quick path to fame and notoriety, it is difficult to grasp the extraordinary bravery and daring of Carolee Schneeman, the pioneering performance artist whose career is lavishly documented in this volume. Decades before "The Body" became an object of safe academic discourse, Schneeman was putting hers on the line, creating a series of films, actions and performances perhaps most notably the majestically Dionysian Meat Joy of 1964 that have become touchstones not only in the history of performance art but also in the development of feminist aesthetics. By its very nature, performance is hard to capture between the covers of a book, but the quality and extent of the images presented here, while no substitute for having been there, capture events with an almost cinematic completeness. Also here in addition to a number of interviews and essays by such critics as David Levi-Strauss and Thomas McEvilley are a number of Schneeman's own writings, which include a description of a formative encounter with poet Charles Olson, whose patriarchal warning that classical drama died when "the c began to speak," Schneeman, with characteristic inventiveness, transforms into good career advice. In fact, from a spirited examination of Valerie Solanas to an elegy for slain colleague Ana Mendieta, Schneeman's writings form the book's core, and it is good to have them in one place. What emerges most powerfully from this book which also covers (with 150 illustrations) Schneeman's work in painting, photography and video is the artist's extraordinarily generous and questing personality. In an era when so much art seems directed at the audience with a sneer, Schneeman's Emersonian optimism and joie de vivre are both example and challenge. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>American Conservatism and the American Founding</h2><p>2002 reprint by the Claremont Institute of the original work, of the same name, published in 1984 by Carolina Academic Press. <p>This book is the fourth in a series (including <i>Equality and Liberty</i>, <i>The Conditions of Freedom</i>, and <i>How to Think About the American Revolution</i>) of reprinted works by Harry V.

And yet, for Perry, it was all that and more: an epic adventure that encompassed love, diplomacy, a little hydroponics, and even some danger (like setting yourself on fire). Perry, who is also the author of -<i>Population: 485</i> (2002), propels the story forward as if he were writing a novel, helped by a cast of characters who range from the lightly offbeat to the totally bizarre. The prose is straightforward, almost deadpan, but behind the words, the reader feels a heightened sense of irony, as though Perry knows how weird it all is but figures, what the heck, it's true so why not just go with it. The heart of the book tells dual love stories--man and truck; man and woman--that are, in their own ways, equally passionate. Perry writes about fixing his truck as if he was resurrecting it, but in fact, he may more accurately be said to have been resurrecting himself. The truck is transformed, certainly, but the multiplicity of changes that Perry goes through run deeper and likely will last longer. Recommend this one enthusiastically to fans of self--exploration books and truck-repair manuals--and all readers in between.

Her religious background, the magic of fairytales, and the numinous experience of nature continue to inform her work.*Starred Review* The prequel to <i>The Passion of Mary Magdalen</i> (2006) lets us in on how a redheaded Celtic lass wound up the literal bride of Christ, and whereas <i>Passion</i> was deeply based in the New Testament (and the sociology of Roman brothels), <i>Magdalen Rising</i> is rooted in Celtic lore. Mary, nee Maeve, was born to weather-witches on a magical, floating island somewhere in the Celtic lands. Raised with unconditional maternal love and with few restraints on body or soul, she grows to be a glorious creature, with plenty of the talents that her possibly divine mothers used for witchcraft. Yes, she has more than one mother, though it would be giving away the store to explain how. She also has a destiny that she encounters in a vision of a man in desert garb taking a leak--a trademark Cunningham touch, both intensely religious and frankly, even humorously, embodied. When she meets that man at druid school, their fated love begins to unfold. Is he Esus, doomed god of the Celts, or Jesus, doomed god of the Jews, or both? Is she goddess or woman or both? Cunningham plays with complex theological issues--the role of embodiment in salvation, the gender of divinity, the question of sacrifice--but she is preeminently a storyteller, and the reader engages those questions within a marvelous, romantic tale. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The couple attended Pasadena College (now Point Loma Nazarene College) together, where Rev. Glover earned a master of arts degree. He has pastored churches in California and the northwestern United States for many years, while Mrs. Glover has pursued her love of Christian writing. That love has resulted in contributions to over 50 Christian publications, including the Christian Standard, Decision, the Herald of Holiness, Home Life, Light and Life, the National Christian Reporter, Standard, the Sunday Digest, Vital Christianity, War Cry, and the Wesleyan Advocate.Meg Shaw has always resented her flamboyant older sister. Marlys found life just a bit easier, with her good looks and charming personality smoothing away any problems she encounters. Then one day handsome Royce Ferguson comes to Toronto to visit his family. Marlys's flirting and lies convince Royce that she would make a fine pioneer wife. Unfortunately, the superficial young woman has no intention of traveling to the wilderness of Wildrose, Prince Albert, to live in a cabin. When a misunderstanding convinces Royce otherwise, Meg travels out to Wildrose to take her sister's place, but Royce isn't interested in the less attractive sister and makes his feelings known. Historical romances may be a dime a dozen in this genre, but the latest "Wildrose" novel (Bitter Thistle, Sweet Rose, Beacon Hill, 1995) stands out. Solid research and historical detail, coupled with realistically human characters struggling with their faith, make this new work a great read.

It is a blow-by-blow historical account, perhaps unique in the literature, which may be the only way to show the full complexity of American Indian relations with federal and state governments. This makes it possible in two brilliant concluding chapters to clarify current Indian points of view and to build onto initiatives that Indians have already taken to suggest which of these might be most useful for them to pursue.

It was nonsense, this insistence on the part of her children and grandchildren that she change the habits of a lifetime. Seventy-six wasn&#x2019;t old, even if that young doctor acted as if she were teetering on the brink of the grave.</p><p>Pausing, she gripped the railing, grateful for its support as she caught her breath. Ach, maybe she <i>was</i> getting on in years, but that didn&#x2019;t mean she had nothing to contribute. There was an important legacy to be passed on, and she&#x2019;d promised herself she wouldn&#x2019;t delay any longer.</p><p>Her three granddaughters would be arriving at the old farmhouse soon. Before they appeared, she needed to take one more look at the treasures collected in the attic.</p><p>Cautiously, conserving her strength, she made her way to the top and paused again, feeling a flash of annoyance at how shallow her breathing was. The straight chair she&#x2019;d used on her last trip to the attic stood where she&#x2019;d left it. Using her cane as a hook, she drew it toward her and sat.</p><p>Sunlight streamed through the window and played across the dozens of objects jammed into the space. Amazing, how quickly the attic of the old farmhouse had filled up. Her quest had begun with one small dower chest belonging to a great-aunt. She&#x2019;d rescued it from being sent to auction at the annual spring mud sale, and it had lit a spark in her heart.</p><p>She&#x2019;d known then what had to be done. Family memories, the whole history of one Amish family in America, were bound up in the items she&#x2019;d collected in her attic. That history couldn&#x2019;t be allowed to die. Someone must see that it lived on.</p><p>Advancing years had caught up with her, and before the farmhouse was sold to a distant cousin, before she moved into her son&#x2019;s house, the memories must be passed on. That was why her granddaughters were coming today.</p><p>Getting to her feet, she made her way across the rough-hewn floorboards, touching a spinning wheel here, a hand-carved rocking horse there. Each of these things must find a new home. It was too much to expect that any one person would take all of them.</p><p>She&#x2019;d hammered out her plan during the long, sleepless nights after the loss of her beloved William. The gifts must be made to the right person. Each object had a story to tell, and each story could influence the person who received it. She breathed a silent prayer, knowing she must rely on God to show her the way.</p><p>It all began with the girls. She smiled. None of the three would appreciate being called a girl; each considered herself a woman grown. And so they were, but that didn&#x2019;t mean they didn&#x2019;t have something to learn from the past.</p><p>Rebecca. Judith. Barbara. She pictured each one in her mind&#x2019;s eye. Rebecca, so lost since the death of her young husband more than a year ago. Judith. She frowned a little. Something was wrong there, but self-contained, quiet Judith would not talk about it, making it more difficult to know what to do. And Barbara. Barbie always brought a smile to her grossmammi&#x2019;s lips, with her pert, lively manner and her almost automatic rebellion against the restrictions of Amish life. Those three were the only ones of the right age to take on the task.</p><p>Elizabeth stood, resting her hand on a dower chest, and faced the truth. This was, most likely, the final challenge of her life. To find the object that would speak to each one of her granddaughters and, through that, to entrust to their generation the promise of their family story.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Rebecca Fisher hadn&#x2019;t summoned her family to meals with the bell on the back porch since Paul died. Today wasn&#x2019;t the day to start, she decided. Instead she stood at the railing and called.</p><p>&#x201c;Katie! Joshua! Come to supper.&#x201d;</p><p>She stayed on the porch until she saw her two kinder running toward the farmhouse. Katie came from the big barn, where she&#x2019;d been &#x201c;helping&#x201d; Rebecca&#x2019;s father and brother with the evening chores. Katie adored her grossdaadi and Onkel Simon, and Rebecca was grateful every day that Katie had them to turn to now that her own daadi was gone.</p><p>Joshua had clearly been up in the old apple tree by the stream, which was his favorite perch. Paul had talked about building a tree house there for Joshua&#x2019;s sixth birthday. That birthday would come soon, but Paul wasn&#x2019;t here to see it. Rebecca&#x2019;s throat tightened, and she forced the thought away.</p><p>&#x201c;Mammi, Mammi.&#x201d; Joshua flung himself at her, grabbing her apron with grubby hands. &#x201c;Guess who I saw?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Josh. Who?&#x201d; She hugged him with one arm and gathered Katie against her with the other. Katie let herself be embraced for a moment and then wiggled free.</p><p>&#x201c;I helped put the horses in,&#x201d; she reported. &#x201c;Onkel Simon said I&#x2019;m a gut helper.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mammi, I&#x2019;m talking.&#x201d; Joshua glared at his sister. &#x201c;Guess who I saw?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hush, now.&#x201d; Rebecca hated it when they quarreled, even though she remembered only too well how she and her brothers and sisters had plagued one another. She shooed them into the kitchen. &#x201c;Katie, I&#x2019;m wonderful glad you&#x2019;re helping. Joshua, who did you see?&#x201d;</p><p>It had probably been an owl or a chipmunk&#x2014;at five, Joshua considered every creature he encountered to be as real as a person.</p><p>&#x201c;Daadi!&#x201d; Joshua grinned, unaware of the hole that had just opened up in his mother&#x2019;s stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;Joshua&#x2014;&#x201d; She struggled to find the words.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s stupid,&#x201d; Katie declared from the superiority of her seven years. Her heart-shaped face, usually so lively and happy, tightened with anger, and her blue eyes sparkled with what might have been the tears she wouldn&#x2019;t shed. &#x201c;Daadi&#x2019;s in heaven. He can&#x2019;t come back, so you can&#x2019;t see him, so don&#x2019;t be stupid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Katie, don&#x2019;t call your brother stupid.&#x201d; Rebecca managed the easier part of the correction first. She knelt in front of her son, feeling the worn linoleum under her knees as she prayed for the right words. &#x201c;Joshua, you must understand that Daadi loves you always, but he can&#x2019;t come back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I saw him, Mammi. I saw him right there in the new stable and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Josh.&#x201d; She had to stop this notion now, no matter how it pained both of them. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you saw, but it wasn&#x2019;t Daadi.&#x201d;</p><p>His small face clouded, his mouth drooping. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d; Her heart hurt as she spoke the words, but they had to be said. Paul was gone forever, and they must continue without him.</p><p>&#x201c;Go and see, Mammi.&#x201d; Josh pressed small hands on her cheeks, holding her face to ensure she paid attention. &#x201c;Please go look in the stable.&#x201d;</p><p>Obviously, it was the only thing that would satisfy him. &#x201c;All right. I&#x2019;ll go and look. While I do that, you two wash up for supper.&#x201d;</p><p>Josh nodded solemnly. Rebecca rose, giving her daughter a warning look.</p><p>&#x201c;No more talking about this until I come back. You understand?&#x201d;</p><p>Katie looked as if she&#x2019;d like to argue, but she nodded as well.</p><p>Pausing to see them headed for the sink without further squabbling, Rebecca slipped out the back door.</p><p>A quick glance told her there was no further activity at the main barn now. Probably her daad and brother had finished and headed home for their own supper.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t far across the field to the farmhouse where she&#x2019;d grown up. That field would be planted with corn before too long. Daad had mentioned it only yesterday, and she&#x2019;d thought how strange it seemed that Paul wasn&#x2019;t here to make the decision.</p><p>Turning in the opposite direction, Rebecca skirted the vegetable garden. Her early onions were already up. In a few weeks the danger of frost would be over, and she could finish the planting.</p><p>Beyond the garden stood the posts from which the farm-stay welcome sign should hang. If she was going to open to visitors this summer, she&#x2019;d have to put it up soon. If. She had to fight back panic at the thought of dealing with guests without Paul&#x2019;s support.</p><p>The farm-stay had been Paul&#x2019;s dream. He&#x2019;d enjoyed every minute of their first season&#x2014;chatting with the guests, showing them how to milk the cows or enlisting their help in cutting hay. It had seemed strange to Rebecca that Englischers would actually pay for the privilege of working on the farm, but it had been so.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been content to stay in the background, cooking big breakfasts, keeping the bedrooms clean, doing all the things she&#x2019;d be doing anyway if the strangers hadn&#x2019;t been staying with them.</p><p>Last summer she&#x2019;d been too devastated by his death to think of opening, but now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, now what was she to do? Would Paul expect her to go on with having guests? She didn&#x2019;t know, because she&#x2019;d never imagined life without him.</p><p>The stable loomed ahead of her, still seeming raw and new even though it had been up for more than a year. They&#x2019;d gone ahead with the building even after Paul&#x2019;s diagnosis, as a sign that they had faith he would be well again.</p><p>But he hadn&#x2019;t been. He&#x2019;d grown weaker and weaker, and eventually she had learned to hate the sight of the stable that had been intended for the purebred draft horses Paul had wanted to breed. She never went near the structure if she could help it.</p><p>Now she had to steel herself to swing open one side of the extra-large double doors. She stepped inside, taking a cautious look around. Dust motes danced in a shaft of sunlight, but otherwise it was silent and empty. The interior seemed to echo of broken dreams.</p><p>Sucking in a breath, Rebecca forced herself to walk all the way to the back wall, her footsteps hollow on the solid wooden floorboards. No one was here. Joshua&#x2019;s longing for his daadi had led him to imagine what he hoped for.</p><p>A board creaked behind her and Rebecca whirled, heart leaping into her throat.</p><p>A man stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the light so that she couldn&#x2019;t make out his face. But Amish, judging by his clothes and straw hat, so not a stranger. The man took a step forward, and she could see him.</p><p>For a long moment they simply stared at each other. Her brain seemed to be moving sluggishly, taking note of him. Tall, broad-shouldered, with golden-brown hair and eyes. He didn&#x2019;t have a beard, so she could see the cleft in his chin, and the sight stirred vague memories. She knew him, and yet she didn&#x2019;t. It wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Matt? Matthew Byler?&#x201d;</p><p>A flicker of a smile crossed his face. &#x201c;Got it right. And you&#x2019;re little Becky Lapp, ain&#x2019;t so?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rebecca Fisher,&#x201d; she corrected quickly. So Matt Byler had returned home to Brook Hill at last. Nothing had been seen of him among the central Pennsylvania Amish since his family migrated out west when he was a teenager.</p><p>Matt came a step closer, making her aware of the height and breadth of him. He&#x2019;d grown quite a lot from the gangling boy he&#x2019;d been when he left. &#x201c;You married Paul Fisher, then. You two were holding hands when you were eight or nine, the way I remember it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She let that trail off. Matt had been a couple of years older than they were, and he&#x2019;d been the kind of boy Amish parents held up as a b...</p></p><h2>The World for a Shilling</h2><p>Conceived as a showcase for Britain&#39;s burgeoning manufacturing industries and the exotic products of its Empire, the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace was Britain&#39;s first national spectacle. This book examines the story of how the exhibition came into being; the key characters who made it happen (from Prince Albert, who was credited with the idea, to Thomas Cook, whose cheap railway trips ensured its accessibility to all); and the tales behind the exhibitors and exhibits themselves, from the Koh-i-noor diamond to the more quirky inventions on display - Queen Victoria was very taken with a bed that physically ejected its occupant in the morning, for example.

On the other hand, they might be heading towards murder. An exotic slave woman, a Siamese cat and a den of conspirators unite to snatch away Amelia&#39;s happiness unless she reveals a certain secret...and at the remote dig in Amarna what she uncovers is a shocking present-day peril: the loss of treasures far more precious than any antiquity - her husband&#39;s love or both their lives!</p><p>A brand-new Elizabeth Peters novel is one of the uncompromising pleasures in life. As Peter Theroux in the New York Times Book Review points out, &#34;Her wonderfully witty voice and her penchant for history lessons of the Nile both ancient and modern keep (her) high adventure moving for even the highest brows&#34;. In her previous outing, The Last Camel Died at Noon, Amelia Peabody and her dashing husband, Emerson, discovered a fabulous lost oasis in the Nubian desert. Now, in the seventh mystery in the series, the Emerson-Peabodys are traveling up the Nile once again to encounter their most deadly adversary, the Master Criminal, who is back at his sinister best. Amelia Peabody was unabashedly proud of her newest translation, a fragment of the ancient fairytale &#34;The Doomed Prince&#34;. Later, she would wonder why no sense of foreboding struck her as she retold the story of the king&#39;s favorite son who had been warned that he would die from the snake, the crocodile, or the dog. Little did she realize, as she and her beloved husband sailed blissfully toward the pyramids of ancient Egypt, that those very beasts (and a cat as well) would be part of a deadly plot. The expedition began so happily....Leaving their delightful, but catastrophically precocious, son, Ramses, back in England, Amelia hoped this romantic trip might rejuvenate her thirteen-year-old marriage and bring back the thrills that she feared were fading. She and her dear Emerson were returning to the remote desert site where they had first fallen in love, Amarna, the holy city of Akhenaton and his beautiful queen, Nefertiti. But their return would threaten not only their marriage, but their very lives with perils as chilling as a mummy&#39;scurse. An old enemy was determined to learn Amelia and Emerson&#39;s most closely guarded secret: the location of a legendary long-lost oasis and a race of people bedecked in gold. So cunning was his scheme that Amelia might overlook - until it was too late - the truth about the mysterious cat called Anubis, the identity of the spy among their retinue, and the nature of the stunning blow that could rob her of all she held dear. A quintessential Elizabeth Peters adventure, The Snake, the Crocodile and the Dog will sweep readers toward an ingenious climax designed to shock and utterly surprise us all.Elizabeth Peters is a prolific and successful author with over fifty novels to her credit. She is internationally renowned for her mystery stories, especially those featuring Amelia Peabody, her Victorian lady-sleuth whom the Philadelphia Inquirer calls &#39;the most potent female force to hit Egypt since Cleopatra!&#39; Elizabeth Peters lives in the USA.</p><h2>Brassai: Paris</h2><p><strong>Harlots, hoodlums, and heathens in Brassaï¿½'s Paris</strong> &nbsp; "Brassaï¿½ is a living eye," wrote Henry Miller of the Hungarian&#x2013;born artist who adopted Paris after World War I and became one of its most celebrated photographers. Originally a painter before he moved on to writing, sculpture, cinema and, most famously, photography, Brassaï¿½ (1899-1984) was a member of Paris&#x2019;s cultural elite, counting Miller, Picasso, Sartre, Camus, and Cocteau, among his friends. Camera in hand, he scoured the streets and bars of Paris, unabashedly capturing the city&#x2019;s inhabitants in their natural habitats. Prostitutes, hoodlums, and other &#x2018;marginal&#x2019; characters were the most famous heroes of Brassaï¿½&#x2019;s moody, gritty photographs taken often by night. Including an extensive selection of Brassaï¿½&#x2019;s finest photographs and an essay describing his life and work, this book explores the world of Brassaï¿½ in thematic chapters: Minotaure magazine, Paris at Night, Secret Paris, Day Visions, Artists of My Life, and Graffiti and Transmutations.</p><p></p><h2>The Power of Words and the Wonder of God</h2><p><p>Words carry immeasurable significance: The universe was created with a word; Jesus healed and cast out demons with a word; rulers have risen and fallen by their words; Christians have worshiped through words of song, confession, and preaching.

His journalism on secret government programs received the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting. As a correspondent for The New York Times, he covered war and terrorism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Sudan, and other nations. He directs the Carey Institute&#39;s nonfiction residency program in upstate New York and teaches as an Anschutz Distinguished Fellow in American Studies at Princeton.In this book based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles for the Philadelphia Inquirer , journalist Weiner probes the way the Pentagon has used secret budgets to fund huge military programs. This has grown to the point that there are now more than 100 multimillion- and multibillion-dollar weapons systems, many of them nuclear weapons designed to fight and win World Wars III and IV, built without the awareness of the public or even the Congress. Weiner takes a close look at programs such as the Stealth bomber and provides fascinating detail from Congressional testimony. The thesis of the book--that secrecy in government military programs is antithetical to democracy--is well documented and hugely important. As the Cold War draws to a close and military budgets come under attack, the public and Congress may tend to forget the defense establishment's inclination toward secrecy and self-perpetuation. Weiner's book serves as a timely reminder that this would be unwise.

He and his wife, Mary, live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Purpose and Overview<br><br> The story of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) is fundamentally a forty-year saga encompassing the creation of a new technology, the building of a company that became the number two computer company in the United States with $14 billion in sales at its peak, the decline and ultimate sale of that company to the Compaq Corporation in 1998, and the preservation in its many alumni of the values that were the essence of the culture of that company. (The company&#x2019;s official name was Digital Equipment Corporation, and its logo was &#x201c;D.I.G.I.T.A.L.&#x201d; or &#x201c;Digital,&#x201d; but common usage around the company was typically &#x201c;DEC,&#x201d; so we will adopt that usage throughout this book.) That culture was an almost pure model of what we can think of as a &#x201c;culture of innovation.&#x201d; It created the minicomputer revolution and laid the groundwork for the interactive computing that today is taken for granted. The managerial values and processes that were at the heart of that culture produced an almost uniformly positive response in DEC employees throughout its history.<br><br> The DEC culture emphasized&#x2014;to an extraordinary degree&#x2014;creativity, freedom, responsibility, openness, commitment to truth, and having fun. Not only were these values central in its early formative years but even when it was an organization of 100,000 people and over $10 billion in sales, these values held firm. DEC&#x2019;s management model empowered the people who worked there, and most of the employees internalized these values and expressed them in their careers with other companies.<br><br> In choosing the title of this book, we thought about the British Empire, which disappeared as a major political entity yet instilled its values in the former colonies that eventually became stronger than the parent. DEC disappeared as a company, yet former DEC engineers and managers populated the computer industry and became major contributors to other companies. The DEC culture lived on in the &#x201c;colonies&#x201d; that it spawned or helped to develop.<br><br> WHAT IS TO BE LEARNED FROM THE DEC STORY?<br><br> The lessons to be learned from this story are many. In our effort to learn from it, we will be asking the following questions:<br><br> 1. How is a culture of product innovation created, and how does it evolve?<br><br> 2. What are the essential ingredients of such a culture in terms of the managerial values and practices it displays?<br><br> 3. What contributions did DEC make to the growing technology of computing and to management practices?<br><br> 4. How did the &#x201c;genetic structure,&#x201d; the DNA of such a culture, produce extraordinary results without containing what can be thought of as a pure commercial or &#x201c;money gene&#x201d; ?<br><br> 5. How were the traditional business functions handled in such a culture of innovation?<br><br> 6. How did success, growth, and age create particular organizational problems that had to be managed?<br><br> 7. How did technical progress create changes in competition and in the marketplace that required cultural evolution?<br><br> 8. How was that cultural evolution inhibited by the very success that the organization experienced?<br><br> 9. How is it that essential elements of a culture survived, while DEC, the economic entity, disappeared?<br><br> Why is it important to learn more about these nine issues? Primarily because every organization as it matures goes through developmental stages that require the making of choices, and these choices often involve difficult trade-offs between conflicting values. Yet these choices determine the future of the organization. The DEC story is a unique opportunity to study in some detail how the choices made at various developmental stages had both desirable and undesirable consequences. Entrepreneurs, investors, consultants, managers, and organization theorists can all benefit from seeing how complex these choices can become when one looks at one organization in detail and over a long period of time.<br><br> WHY IS DEC AN ORGANIZATION WORTH STUDYING?<br><br> DEC as a Classic Case of Entrepreneurial Leadership<br><br> One of the key values in the DEC culture was &#x201c;Do the right thing.&#x201d; In emphasizing &#x201c;Doing the right thing,&#x201d; the DEC culture created a unique climate that stimulated leadership at all levels. The DEC story is therefore also a story about the triumph and, in the end, the &#x201c;tragedy&#x201d; of technical, organizational, and social leadership. Warren Bennis, the eminent researcher of leadership, has pointed out that the difference between leadership and management is that managers &#x201c;do things right,&#x201d; while leaders &#x201c;do the right thing.&#x201d; In DEC &#x201c;Do the right thing&#x201d; was a license both to insubordination and to leadership. As we will see, DEC, more than any other company of its size and scale that I am aware of, created leaders at every level of its organization. And, as we will also see, a culture built around leaders creates its own turmoil and difficulties.<br><br> The DEC story is about leadership not only in technical innovation but also in management practice, manufacturing, community relations, affirmative action, sales and service practices, and, perhaps most important, human development. Ken Olsen, DEC&#x2019;s founder, articulated values that are frequently touted as being the essence of what a good organization should be, and it maintained those values for thirty-five years. Those same values created in the end an economic problem that led to disaster for the company. But the DEC story leaves us with two huge questions. Would it have been possible to save the economic entity without giving up those values, that is, without destroying the culture? And, in the end, what is more valuable&#x2014;the culture or the company?<br><br> Fundamental questions also arise as to whether DEC&#x2019;s ultimate contribution was to technology or to management practice. Did the technological vision dictate a certain management style, or did a certain management style enable extraordinary technical achievements? Was it Ken Olsen&#x2019;s technical vision that created DEC&#x2019;s successes, or was it his organizational genius that fostered what came to be known as a world-class engineering organization under the leadership of Gordon Bell? Was it the culture that Olsen created that attracted talents like Gordon Bell and made possible the building of an organization in which world-class engineers wanted to work? Or was DEC&#x2019;s success the product of the interaction of Ken Olsen&#x2019;s and Gordon Bell&#x2019;s visions and management practices?<br><br> A Classic Example of Organizational Culture Dynamics<br><br> Why focus on culture? Culture creation and culture change are a constant source of preoccupation these days for entrepreneurs and executives. Hardly a day goes by without seeing a newspaper story or a book announcement about an executive who is &#x201c;changing the culture&#x201d; or &#x201c;creating a new culture&#x201d; in his or her company, usually to stimulate innovation in a rapidly changing technical environment. We see calls for &#x201c;service cultures,&#x201d; &#x201c;cultures of empowerment,&#x201d; &#x201c;teamwork cultures,&#x201d; &#x201c;cultures of openness,&#x201d; &#x201c;trust cultures,&#x201d; and, most recently and emphatically, &#x201c;cultures of innovation.&#x201d; Everyone seems to want to know how to create innovation, especially in older companies that seem to have lost their innovative edge. And it is increasingly recognized that culture creation and culture management are the essence of leadership.<br><br> One of the main preoccupations of entrepreneurs and company founders is how to &#x201c;create the right culture&#x201d; or &#x201c;preserve the culture that they have created.&#x201d; Yet little is known about creating or preserving a culture. Leaders in more mature companies seem to believe that announcing a culture of innovation from a position of influence is sufficient to make it happen or that they can &#x201c;change&#x201d; culture to fit the new requirements of the market. Few of these executives question whether cultures of innovation formed around products, processes, or management systems would actually solve the particular business problems that they are encountering. Few of them question whether certain cultures should be retained even if they produce economic difficulties.<br><br> We don&#x2019;t have a coherent theory or set of concepts for culture &#x201c;process.&#x201d; We don&#x2019;t understand well enough how culture works&#x2014;how it is created; how it evolves; how it changes; and how it influences strategy, structure, and business processes. It is precisely this absence of knowledge that makes executives nervous about culture as a concept. Culture appears to be something that is difficult to control; hence, it is often avoided when strategy and process are discussed. Yet as we will see, in a mature organization culture pervades everything, even the most fundamental economic decisions that the board and senior executives make. A better understanding of cultural dynamics in relationship to technology and organizational evolution is therefore not a choice; it is a necessity.<br><br> One can write about how culture and leadership work in the abstract, providing case illustrations as one goes. I have done this in two of my previous books, Organizational Culture and Leadership (1992) and The Corporate Culture Survival Guide (1999). What remains to be done is to look at one or more of these cases in greater depth to appreciate the subtle dynamic processes that are at work in organizational cultures and to show how these processes explain the rise and fall of organizations, particularly ones that seemed to be on the road to success yet could not sustain themselves. And it is especially important to understand better the role of leadership in the creation, maintenance, evolution, and ultimately destruction of a given organizational culture.<br><br> One of the most dramatic of these cases is DEC, an organization my contributing authors and I came to know intimately as consultants or employees or both from 1966 to 1992. DEC virtually transformed the computing landscape and rose to be the number two computer maker with a $14 billion sales volume in 1992, which put it in the top fifty corporations in the United States. Ed Roberts in his seminal book on high tech entrepreneurs calls DEC &#x201c;the most successful MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] spin-off company&#x201d; (Roberts 1991, p. 12). Ken Olsen was called by Fortune magazine in 1986 &#x201c;arguably the most successful entrepreneur in the history of American business.&#x201d; DEC&#x2019;s economic rise was accompanied by a myriad of contributions to technology, to management theory and practice, to production processes, to the utilization of women and minorities in industry, and to community relations. Common to all of these contributions was a set of cultural dynamics that made extraordinary things possible. What can these cultural dynamics teach us?<br><br> Culture works its influences in many ways. First of all, DEC was created at a time in U.S. society when social values were moving toward more individualism and where technology was facilitating this trend. Not only was Ken Olsen, the key architect of the company, brought up at a time when certain postwar values were salient, but the whole design thrust of DEC&#x2019;s products toward distributed interactive computing reflected decentralization, rejection of formal authority, empowerment of the individual, and, at the same time, the networking of individuals for greater efficiency. Peter DeLisi, coming from IBM, noted immediately that the IBM mainframe was symbolic of authority and centralization, while DEC&#x2019;s time-shared and networked computers were symbolic of individualism and freedom (DeLisi 1998). In other words, product design does not occur in a vacuum; it reflects social trends and social issues. When DEC appeared on the scene, social norms supported and stimulated the kinds of products that were designed.<br><br> DEC as One of the First Dot-Coms: A Knowledge Company before Its Time<br><br> As the world gets more complex, organizations are more than ever dependent on knowledge workers and knowledge management. Many observers and analysts of DEC saw it as one of the first and most vivid examples of a knowledge-based company with a culture in which knowledge creation and management were highly valued and in which networking and open exchange of knowledge was a central management principle. (Debra Rogers Amidon noted this in a 1991 management memo that is reproduced in appendix C. Two of the first books on networking as a business organization concept were published by DEC employees Jessica Lipnack and Jeffrey Stamps [1993, 1994]. Debra Amidon has also published two books on the &#x201c;knowledge economy,&#x201d; based on insights first gained at DEC [Amidon 1997, 2003]). Several alumni have pointed out that because of DEC&#x2019;s early use of networking, it was one of the first companies ever to be assigned a &#x201c;dot-com&#x201d; address by the U.S. government. As we will see, there are many lessons to be learned from DEC, both about how one creates an effective knowledge-based company and what managerial dilemmas and dysfunctions can arise in such an organization as it gets larger and more differentiated. Even though DEC failed as a business, the management systems and principles it instituted around networks and knowledge management are seen by many as a blueprint for how future organizations will have to be designed and managed. In particular there are lessons for decision-making theory. Knowledge workers operate from different premises when they have to reach consensus in a network in the absence of hierarchical authority.<br><br> DEC as a Classic Case ofValues-Based Management<br><br> Much is written these days about values-based management and the need for management to clearly articulate its values. DEC is a classic case of an organization that was built on its founder&#x2019;s very clear set of values. Ken Olsen&#x2019;s values were written down, articulated throughout DEC&#x2019;s history, used explicitly in the training and socialization of new employees, restated explicitly in company documents of all sorts, and adhered to with a passion right to the end. In most organizations there is a disconnect between articulated values and actual management practices. In DEC, to a surprising degree, the values were reflected in actual work practices and became thoroughly embedded in the culture. Many DEC values had a strong moral imperative, which gave them stability and which makes it possible to see both the strengths and weaknesses of this degree of values-based management.<br><br> DEC created what would, by any definition, be thought of as a strong corporate culture. The basic question then is to what extent such a culture can evolve as technology and organizational requirements change. An even more fundamental question is whether such highly valued managerial practices should evolve and change. Should values change to support organizations, or are organizations an expression of human values? And if they cannot sustain those values, should organizations die?<br><br> DEC as a Classic Case of Technological Evolution to Commodification<br><br> The DEC story illustrates clearly the difficult challenge of modifying an organization to adapt to changing market conditions as its own technological innovations create new markets. Especially difficult is the move from a culture of innovation, based on one set of managerial values, to an organization geared to producing commodity products that typically require a different set of managerial values and practices. As Paul Kampas&#x2019;s analysis in chapter 9 shows, the failure of DEC&#x2019;s culture of innovation to coevolve with changing market conditions lead to inefficiencies and ultimately to economic failure. The very success of the early innovation created competitive forces that changed the nature of the innovation, stimulated disruptive technologies and market demands, and therefore created a need for organizational transformation. That transformation may have been beyond the organization&#x2019;s ability or will to manage, ...</p><h2>Eat Yourself Slim: Adapted for North America</h2><p>Dimensions (in inches): 0.55 x 9.00 x 6.04 Canadian Edition (new English translation).</p><p>Since 1986, Michel Montignac has revolutionized the way Europeans eat. The Montignac Method has taught people how to eat healthier while at the same time lose and maintain their ideal weight. It also helps to decrease cardiovascular risks. Whats more, cardiologists and nutritionists the world over heartily endorse the Montignac Method. <p>In this book, Michel Montignac will explain how : <br>- To forget about calorie counting <br>- To eat right kinds of foods without restrictions <br>- To plan and make your own meals without fuss <br>- To distinguish between good fats to help you control cholesterol <br>- To chose low glycemic index carbohydrates, which help weight loss <br>- To avoid high glycemic index carbohydrates, which are responsible for weight gain <br>- To enjoy a glass of wine with you meals <br>- To dine at restaurants and festive occasions without worry </p><p>Michel Montignac, a native of France, published his French version of Eat Yourself Slim in 1987. Since then, it has sold in 35 countries and has been translated into 18 languages. Famous Chefs, movie stars, royalty and ordinary people alike praised the Montignac Method because it celebrates food while at the same time enhances health.</p>Born in southwest France (Angoulme) in 1944, Michel Montignac went on to study political science and established a professional career in Human Resource management before specializing in nutrition. With a family history of obesity (Mr. Montignac's father weighed 265 lbs) and having suffered himself with excess weight during his youth, he soon became interested in all that concerned good nutrition. <p>In the early 1980's, while holding the position of European personnel director for a large American multinational pharmaceutical firm, he turned his attention and energies to the study of nutrition. This subject was all the more important considering his required daily business lunches. </p><p>By studying the scientific documents now available to him, he began to develop theories as to the true causes of weight gain and the measures that could be taken to lose weight without restricting the amount of food eaten. </p><p>Being at ease with both the written and spoken word, Mr. Montignac set out to make known to the public the results of his research after having successfully tried his methods on those closest to him and on himself, by losing 35 lbs in 3 months. </p><p>This success prompted him in 1986 to write his first book intended for businessmen entitled "Comment maigrir en faisant des repas d'affaires" (How to Lose Weight While Enjoying Business Lunches). In 1987 he followed with a new publication for the general public entitled "Je mange donc je maigris" (Eat Yourself Slim). This book broke all sales records and became a best seller, and over the past 10 years more than 7 million copies have been sold in 25 countries. </p><p>Following the publication of four recipe books, the 1994 appearance of "La Mthode MONTIGNAC Spcial Femme" (The MONTIGNAC Method Ladies Special Edition) assured him a prominent place in the field of diet and nutrition. </p><p>Though at first received with some caution and skepticism, the MONTIGNAC Method has taken hold through word of mouth and has proven its effectiveness, thanks to the impressive and long-lasting results achieved by those who up until then had fought a losing battle with excess weight. The overwhelming acceptance of Michel MONTIGNAC's theories within the medical community, both in France and abroad, has made the author a nutrition specialist on whom to rely. As a result, he has become a much sought-after speaker at international symposiums on nutrition. </p><p>In 1996, Michel MONTIGNAC published "Restez jeune en mangeant mieux" (Eat Well and Stay Young), a book intended for people over 50 years of age, as well as a book on the therapeutic benefits of wine entitled "Boire du vin pour rester en bonne sant" (Drink Wine To Stay In Good Health). </p><p>For many years, critics of Michel Montignac, comprising for the most part traditional nutritionists, have tried to undermine his credibility by claiming that his nutritional practices were not scientifically proven and perhaps even dangerous, despite the obvious effectiveness of his Method.

Hollywood Boulevard, with its bars and used-book stores and the legendary Chinese Theater, is the psychic killing ground where Sydney must learn the rules of an old supernatural rivalry -- and choose to save either the woman he loves, or his soul.</p><p>In this taut, eerie novella from Powers (<i>Three Days to Never</i>), used-book hunter George Sydney finds he can summon a beautiful poet when he discovers a signed volume containing a previously unknown variant of one sonnet. The good news is that he can bring the mysterious woman, Cheyenne Fleming, back to life. The bad news is that if he does, he will never meet her, and the act itself may harm an innocent. Set in Los Angeles, Powers's intricate story shows how Sydney's loneliness and alcoholism leaves him vulnerable to someone (or something) that is not what it appears to be. There are no thin, hairy specters lurking in this tale, and no cold grue to chill one's bones. Its impact is more moral than visceral, evoking the pity and fear that are hallmarks of tragedy. Exquisitely illustrated by J.K. Potter, this slender volume is sure to appeal to epicures of the terrible. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

On the islands, much of history is related verbally and passed on from generation to generation, and many of the stories are told differently, but now we have a written record as a beginning basis. This book is hard to find but well worth the effort if you like to wander the tropical islands, especially researching information about the colonial powers such as Spain, Germany, Japan, and the USA at the end of World War II.

Far more than a gold-plated symbol of religious belief, the cross is the centerpiece of the Christian faith-the meeting place of time and eternity, where God and man encounter each other. Max Lucado takes you through the drama of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ-bringing to life Peter&#39;s denial, Pilate&#39;s hesitancy, and John&#39;s loyalty. Relive the events leading up to Jesus&#39; crucifixion, from the foggy garden of Gethsemane to the incandescent room of the resurrection. No Wonder They Call Him Savior leads you up the hill of mankind&#39;s highest hope and reminds you why he deserves to be called our Savior.</p><p></p><h2>Stacking Wood</h2><p>The country farmers of the Ausseerland in Austria take a special pride in one of life&#39;s most humble tasks: the building of a woodpile.

It may last for one day or a few months and consists of experiences that blur the boundaries of life and art&#x2014;is that subway mariachi band, used book of poetry, or meal with a new friend real or a part of the performance?<br><br> Central to this book is their 2013 performance for Rick Moody, author of <em>The Ice Storm</em>. His Odyssey lasted four months and included a fake children's book, introducing the themes of his performance, and a cello concert in a Saskatchewan prairie (which Moody almost missed after being stopped at customs with, suspiciously, no idea why he was traveling to Canada).<br><br> The book includes Moody's interviews with Odyssey Works, an original short story by Amy Hempel, and six proposals for a new theory of making art.</p><p>Abraham Burickson is the co-founder and artistic director of Odyssey Works. Burickson was trained in architecture at Cornell University. His work spans writing, design, performance, and sound art, and has been profiled in the New York Times, The Believer, ArtInfo, Fast Company, Vulture, Archinect, the SF Bay Guardian, SF Weekly, and elsewhere.<br><br>Ayden LeRoux, the assistant director of Odyssey Works, is an artist, writer, and translator based in Brooklyn. LeRoux' photography, performance, video and installation have been presented by Flux Factory, chashama, and the International Photography Festival and have been exhibited in China, Cuba, Greece, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&#34;At times, reading Odyssey Works and trying to put yourself in the shoes of an audience member feels like waking up in The Matrix, where someone else is playing god with your life. It&#39;s odd and more than a little unsettling. But Odyssey Works: Transformative Experiences for an Audience of One is so unique in subject matter and approach that it can&#39;t help but offer new insights on art and the facets of art that can transform lives. Even if you find the core concept downright creepy, you will still find something in these pages that will make you think-about how you approach art, about how you create art, or both.&#34; - Independent Publisher</p><h2>Early Italian Writing-Books: Renaissance to Baroque</h2><p>Before his death in 1967, the English typographic historian Stanley Morison had drafted a major work explaining the history and development of early Italian writing books. The text, which was the result of years of involvement in a subject always close to Morison s heart, was close to completion and was sent to James Wells, the Curator of the Wing Collection at Chicago s famous Newberry Library for initial editing and revisions. Wells returned the manuscript with massive notes-so many that Morison was obliged to rewrite his text entirely. He dedicated to Carla Marzoli, who had commissioned the work, and entrusted it to Nicholas Barker for final editing.<br><br>At last, this manuscript has been completed and it here appears in a format and at a price at which even Morison would have rejoiced. Printed in letterpress, with 24 duotone offset illustrations, this book examines the calligraphy of the sixteenth century from Arrighi to Ugo da Carpi, from Tagliente to Celebrino da Udine. As always with Morison, it is full of surprises, for this was Morison s particular passion, and in the area of stylistic comparisons and close observation, Morison was an undisputed master. This is, then, not only the last major Morison text to be published, but also one of fundamental importance, covering the most important period (and the most beautiful examples) in the history of calligraphy.<br><br>Published by Martino Mardersteig s Edizioni Valdonega, it is being released in America exclusively by David R.

Nearly three already. In preparation to leave his desk, he blotted the numbers he'd just tallied, then rubbed his ink-stained fingers on his denim trousers. There was something he did every afternoon at this time.</p><p>"Gonna be trouble at the North Star!" The tall stoop-shouldered man who tended bar rapped on Jonas's open office door at the same time as he shouted.</p><p>The North Star was the three-story hotel a few doors down, where Jonas and most of his employees lived. Jonas owned the hotel as well as the Silver Star Saloon.</p><p>"Tall fella, but not beefy," Quay told him. "He's hollerin' for Mrs. Holmes."</p><p>Jonas didn't bother to grab his jacket. He might talk this man into leaving peaceably, but experience had taught him it might take more than a simple <i>please </i>to appeal to an abuser. No call to ruin a perfectly good coat.</p><p>He glanced at the holstered Colt hanging on a peg just inside the door, but deliberately walked past and locked the door behind him.</p><p>With the shutters open to the warm afternoon sun, the saloon was warm and bright. The freshly scrubbed floors, the two patrons and the woman polishing the top of the mahogany bar barely registered as he strode for the door and out onto the shaded boardwalk.</p><p>"Madeline, come out here now! Don't make me come in and get you."</p><p>The stranger stood in the street, a sweaty bay tethered to the post in front of the hotel. His tailored black suit was coated with a layer of dust as though he'd been pushing the mare for the better part of a day. In Jonas's book, men who abused horses ranked right up there with men who mistreated women. Jonas had heard Madeline Holmes's story and drew the easy conclusion that this was the man she'd run from before finding refuge in Silver Bend.</p><p>"Don't make me come in there and drag you out!" the man shouted.</p><p>"Looking for someone?" Jonas called easily.</p><p>"Stay outta this, mister. Ain't none of your concern."</p><p>Jonas walked several yards toward the hotel. "Well, seems it is my concern since you're standing there hollerin' at the front windows of my establishment. State your business, Mister..."</p><p>"Baslow. This your hotel?"</p><p>"That it is. Jonas Black's the name. And you are?"</p><p>"I'm lookin' to take a woman back with me. I want Madeline Holmes."</p><p>"Is she your wife?"</p><p>The angry man deepened the scowl on his already craggy face, and his complexion reddened. "Ain't none of your damned business what she is. All you need to know is that she's comin' with me."</p><p>"I guess we can leave that up to Maddie, now, can't we?"</p><p>At Jonas's familiar use of her name, Baslow turned his whole body toward Jonas and squinted. "What's she to you?"</p><p>"A good employee. I'll go tell her you're here and you can ask her directly what she'd like to do."</p><p>The man jerked his head toward the saloon Jonas had exited. Quay still stood just outside the doors.</p><p>"She's in there?" Baslow shouted. "Whoring?"</p><p>Jonas gestured to a brightly painted wooden sign that hung on the outside of the building. "No sportin' women in my establishment. Maddie's one of my housekeepers."</p><p>"The hell you say. Madeline!" he roared, stalking toward the saloon.</p><p>Jonas frowned at Baslow's belligerent tone and aggressive stance. Eagerness for the man to try to push past him so he'd have reason to restrain him made his fingers tingle and his blood pump.</p><p>Instead, Baslow gave him a wide berth, striding to face the open saloon doors.</p><p>Casually, Jonas turned and stepped past Quay into the dim interior. This time his gaze sought and found the dark-haired woman who'd stopped polishing the bar and stood in rigid fear, her eyes as wide as saucers, her face pale. "Frank," she said on a dry rasp.</p><p>Jonas thought she might have been pretty once, before abuse and fear had added the appearance of more years to her narrow face. Using intimidation, the man had held her in his home and his bed for eight years. Breaking away had taken courage. Following through with her decision to escape would take even more.</p><p>"You don't have to be afraid," Jonas assured her. "Quay and I are right here. The whole of Silver Bend would see if he tried to force you away in plain sight. You don't have to go back with him. He can't make you. Tell him you don't want to leave. Make it loud 'n clear so there are witnesses."</p><p>Her frightened gaze moved from Jonas to the doorway. He'd seen the same bleak dread on too many faces, and it made his blood boil. "You're free, Maddie. You have a job and can take care of yourself. You don't need him. He has no control over you except what you give him. From here on out you can live your life any way you see fit. It's up to you."</p><p>His words took effect, and her expression changed. Madeline Holmes placed the cloth she'd been holding on the bar and, with precise movements, removed her apron, folded it neatly and set it down. She ran her palms over her skirt in a nervous gesture, then straightened and raised her chin. "He can't make me do anything I don't want to, can he?"</p><p>"No, he can't."</p><p>She walked toward the doors. Jonas followed.</p><p>As she stepped out onto the boardwalk, Baslow's severe gaze narrowed on her. His attention sidled over Jonas and Quay before fixing back on her as though the men were irritating flies he intended to swat later. "If you want to bring anything with you, get it now."</p><p>Her hands trembled, but with obvious deliberation she hid them in the folds of her skirts. Jonas cheered silently for her brave front.</p><p>"I have a job now. And my own room at the hotel," she said, her voice louder than he'd expected, though a slight tremble betrayed her nervousness. "I'm content to stay right here."</p><p>Baslow's thunderous expression darkened even more noticeably.</p><p>A few citizens had gathered on the boardwalk across the street and were watching the goings-on with interest. Wouldn't be the first time a fight had erupted in front of his place, Jonas thought, his blood pounding with keen awareness, and it wouldn't be the last. He had never minded a good fight to clear the air.</p><p>"You choosing a life of whoring over comin' with me?" Baslow bit out between clenched teeth.</p><p>Jonas kept his mouth shut. He'd already told the man there weren't any sporting women at his place, and everyone in town knew it. This was Maddie's chance to speak her piece.</p><p>"That's what I felt like when I was with you," she said, coming straight to the heart of the matter. "I don't want to live that way anymore. I'm not your wife." Her voice and demeanor showed renewed strength in her decision. "Nobody hits me," she declared. "And I get a fair wage for a day's work. I can take care of myself just fine."</p><p>Baslow headed toward Maddie. "I don't know who fed you that hogwash," he said, "but you belong to me, and you'll do as I say."</p><p>She backed away.</p><p>Jonas met him before he could reach the shade of the boardwalk. "Remember the brother's war, Baslow? It's against the law to keep slaves."</p><p>They stood three feet apart. Baslow's right eye twitched with anger. Jonas's palms tingled.</p><p>"Get outta my way, mister, before you regret it."</p><p>"Can't do that. Maddie's my employee, and I take care of my people."</p><p>Baslow lunged toward Jonas. Jonas dodged his first attempt to reach him, spinning with hands locked together to land a blow on the back of the man's neck.</p><p>Caught off guard, Baslow fell to his hands and knees in the dirt, losing his hat. Slowly, he shook his head, and then scrambled to his feet to come after Jonas. The fight was on.</p><p>The growing crowd pushed forward for a better look.</p><p>Energized now, Jonas raised both fists and bent his knees in readiness. Baslow faced him and they squared off, circling in avid concentration. The man's eyes bored into Jonas's with contempt. Jonas studied his stance, his movements, waited to see how he hit. Faster than Jonas anticipated, Baslow landed a blow to Jonas's shoulder that forced him to catch his balance and got him mad. He retaliated with a quick right that landed on the man's jaw with a crack and drew a grunt from his opponent and a murmur from the crowd.</p><p>Jonas didn't feel the hits that came next, though he knew one landed against his ribs and another at his temple. Adrenaline lent him strength and numbed the pain. In the minutes that followed he used the reprieve to his advantage, skillfully finding opportunities to put down punches.</p><p>Half-a-dozen solid hits later Baslow's lip was bleeding. He had a cut over his left eye, and he was breathing hard. Jonas watched for and found an opportunity, hit his eye again, then positioned all his muscle into landing a blow to his gut.</p><p>The man moaned and doubled over, dropping to his knees in the dirt. He glared up at Jonas, one eye red from streaming blood. "You got no right to keep Madeline."</p><p>"You're finally right," Jonas answered. "Nobody's got a right to hold her. She's free to leave, she's free to stay." He turned to Maddie, who'd been watching with both hands clasped under her chin. "You want to go?"</p><p>She shook her head and released a pent-up breath. "No."</p><p>"You sure? 'Cause we don't want any misunder-standin's. You're free to leave any time you want."</p><p>"I want to stay."</p><p>"There you have it." Jonas's knuckles were stinging now. "Need any more convincing?"</p><p>Marshal Haglar parted the crowd and made his way to stand on the brick street a few feet away. He took in both men's appearances. "What in blazes is goin' on here?"</p><p>Maddie immediately ran forward to explain what had taken place. When she'd finished, the marshal turned to the spectators. "That how it happened? Anyone see the whole thing?"</p><p>Jonas couldn't remember if anyone had been there during the initial exchange of words. He scanned the faces nearby. People had an aversion to getting involved, especially when a dangerous-looking fellow like Baslow glared at them as though daring someone to speak against him.</p><p>The marshal eyed the crowd, and one after another, the bystanders glanced at the person beside them and then away. Jonas figured his reputation and position on the town council would have enough sway. He wasn't a troublemaker, but he neve...</p></p><h2>The Silent Master: Awakening the Power Within</h2><p>Grandmaster Tae Yun Kim, one of the world&#39;s highest ranking martial artists, has accomplished things people told her were impossible.

Studios, this album features authentic animation art of everyone&#39;s favorite characters. More than 300 color illustrations trace the evolution of the uniquely American art form through the development and growth of the Warner Bros.</p><p>"Before 1977, relatively few people were aware of animation cels as an art form," Beck and Friedwald inaugurally opine. Discussion of collectible cel art soon slips away, though, as the object becomes not to evaluate Warner animation, but to praise it on big, lavishly illustrated pages that are bound for heavy duty. Exhaustiveness is not a concern: Beck and Friedwald spotlight a lesser character like Michigan J. Frog, but not many others, mostly, it seems, because M. J. is the spokes-'toon for Warner's TV network. Still, there is plenty of tribute to major creative stalwarts like voice man Mel Blanc and directors Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, Bob McKimson, Tex Avery, and Chuck Jones. The upbeat exposition even cites a few controversies, such as the trimming of <i>Heckling Hare</i> that contributed to Avery's leaving Warner (what the original ending was or why it was changed are never specified, though). Mickey Mouse may be a more successful corporate shill, but Bugs Bunny is the quintessential funny animal. Celebrate him and his posse with this grand tribute. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Whole Foods: Plant-Based Whole Foods For Beginners: 30 Simple and Tasty Recipes for Exciting Meals and Healthy Weight Loss</h2><p><p><b>After reading this book you will learn all about the plant-based whole food life style</b></p> <p><b>The health and wellness benefits will be incredible!</b></p> Have you ever thought about giving a plant-based diet and lifestyle a try?

An epic voyage undertaken with courage and recounted with flair and humour.</p><p>A.J. Mackinnon was born in Australia in 1963. He got hDiploma in Education and a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature, Linguistics and Anglo-Saxon from the University of Adelaide. His teaching career started at Westminster school, Adelaide, where he taught English and Drama for four years. AFter this time he traveled overland England by yacht, hitch-hiking, river-canoe and even horseback-spending a brief time in a Chinese prison after accidentally swimming into China and being attacked by Komodo Dragons, amongst other experiences.<br><br>In England he taught at Sherborne and Cheltenham before becoming Head of Drama at Ellesmere College, Shropshire, where he also taught English. From Ellesmere he launched his unlikely voyage aboard his dinghy Jack de Crow. He is currently teaching English and Drama at Geelong Grammar School in Australia where he also coaches sailing....[a] blend of high adventure, immeasureable charm and comedy... (<i>Latitudes &amp; Attitudes</i>)<br><br>...a wonderful idea for a book--a series of ever bolder improvisations...undertaken in praise of the spirit of adventure. (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>...one of the most original and entertaining books on sailing and voyaging to come out in years. (<i>Sailing</i>)<br><br>...the cavalier attitude, wit, and romanticism of this book are enough to capture the heart of any adventurer... (<i>WaterCraft</i>)<br><br>...will have you alternately laughing and shaking your head in disbelief at the brilliant insanity of the ill-defined quest. (<i>Cruising World</i>)<br><br>There are as many ways to live aboard as there are boats that float. Some sailors take a more Spartan approach. Mackinnon took this latter style to its perhaps illogical extreme, when he sailed a Mirror dinghy from Wales to the Black Sea. The Mirror is about 11 feet long, and is used primarily as a sail trainer by instructors who believe in giving students lots of strings to pull; it has a gunter mainsail, a tiny jib and a toy spinnaker. I can't imagine a less suitable vessel for a trip across Europe, but this voyage provided the material for a fascinating book. The author borrowed the little boat from the secondary school where he had been teaching, intent on a brief holiday before leaving England. But, seduced by his initial success in battling down small brooks and drainage ditches to the River Severn, he continued on, powered only by oars and that small mainsail, wearing his trademark pith helmet. His achievements encouraged him...and even his frequent disasters proved motivational once he figured out ways to overcome them. Eventually, he reached a port on the English Channel and discovered to his surprise that no one in a position of authority was inclined to forbid him from crossing. So away he went, and fortune preserved him despite a serious navigation error. Once across the Channel, it was clear sailing to the Black Sea. Over the course of this great adventure, he sailed or rowed through 12 countries and 282 locks. Readers may be inclined to dismiss Mackinnon as the sort of amusing, colorful, harmless eccentric famously produced by England, although the author is not English. But there's more to it than that. In his miniscule boat, Mackinnon was not only close to the water, he was close to the hearts of those who saw him rowing his way east, and he was taken in, repaired, fed, and generally treated with great affection by those he met on his voyage. Mackinnon has a pleasant outgoing personality, and he writes with the sort of stylish flair you might expect from a literature teacher. However, the smallness of his boat was probably the largest factor in attracting so much kindness from the strangers along his route. Sometimes he slept under a tarp on the damp floorboards, but more often he stayed with newfound friends. (<i>Living Aboard</i>)<br><br>"This amiable book is about what can, but probably should not, be attempted in a Mirror dinghy...The experience is by turns cheering and terrifying, but always met with humor and described with style...It's the sort of book people buy in quantities to give to their friends." (<i>Classic Boat</i>)</p><h2>Santa Comes to Little House (My First Little House Books)</h2><p>As Christmas approaches, Laura and Mary wonder if Santa will be able to find them on the vast prairie, but someone special is looking out for the Ingalls family and will make sure that Santa pays them a visit, in a wonderful Yuletide tale illustrated with lavish oil paintings and excerpted from the classic story, Little House on the Prairie.</p><p>Laura Ingalls Wilder was born in 1867 in the log cabin described in <i>Little House in the Big Woods.</i> As her classic Little House books tell us, she and her family traveled by covered wagon across the Midwest. She and her husband, Almanzo Wilder, made their own covered-wagon trip with their daughter, Rose, to Mansfield, Missouri. There Laura wrote her story in the Little House books, and lived until she was ninety years old. For millions of readers, however, she lives forever as the little pioneer girl in the beloved Little House books.Kindergarten-Grade 4-How are Santa and his reindeer going to make it to Mary and Laura's house with the creek so swollen with water and them so far away in Indian Territory? Mr. Edwards, their neighbor, won't be able to join them for Christmas dinner, either, as he lives on the other side of the creek. As Ma begins to prepare the wild turkey that Pa has killed for their dinner, the cabin has an air of somberness. Christmas does come to the little house, but in a much different way than Mary and Laura expected. Graef's illustrations, done in soft, warm colors, elicit the feeling of times gone by and make the story accessible to a wide age group. As with other picture books created from text excerpted from the "Little House" books (HarperCollins), readers will not benefit from Wilder's rich and skillful development of characters; without the context of the complete story, they will not be as involved in the action. Nonetheless, this is a sweet family read-aloud for veterans of the series, or a way to introduce these sisters to younger audiences.<br><i>P.

Certainly, no one could ever have guessed that a small boy from the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania would one day become America&#39;s most famous cowboy. The first half of The Life and Legend of Tom Mix tells of the first thirty years of his life - the years before fame and fortune, years of character development and struggle. These are the years that biographers tend to skip over, and yet these are the years that provide the greatest understanding of the man a nation grew to love. Tom Mix was different as a boy, soldier, and Wild West Show performer. He was a dreamer and the criticism of parents, relatives and friends was never able to break his spirit. He faced up to life&#39;s challenges and the unknown and usually triumphed over them. But this is not the typical publicity or heroic &#39;Big Little Book&#39; story of Tom Mix, because failures, heartaches and flops are discussed in equal detail. The second half of the book tells of the Tom Mix that most people think they knew. It covers the last thirty years of the cowboy actor&#39;s life - the years of great fame and fortune, the years when he became a legend in his own time. These are also the years of age, when a man slows down and has time to reflect on his past. Tom Mix and Tony will always be remembered for their stunts on the silver screen. But Tom should also be remembered as a promoter of cowboy sports, the events which led to our present-day rodeo concept. Most people agree that the team of Tom Mix and Tony has never been equalled. The story of Tom Mix is more than just another biography of a famous man. It is a picture history - 125 rare photos have been included - and recorded western Americana. In these pages, you will discover a little more about the &#39;Old West,&#39; Wild West Shows, Rodeos, Silent Pictures, the Circus and &#39;Talkies.&#39;</p><p></p><h2>Red Lightning (Red Thunder)</h2><p>The son of one of the pioneering explorers of Mars, a disgruntled Ray Garcia-Strickland is bored with life on the Red Planet and tired of the overdevelopment and tourist Earthies, but when Earth is struck by a mysterious object, causing a massive tsunami, he is forced to return to Earth to help solve one of its greatest mysteries.</p><p>John Varley is the author of the Gaean Trilogy (<b>Titan</b>, <b>Wizard</b>, and <b>Demon</b>), <b>Steel Beach</b>, <b>The Golden Globe</b>, <b>Red Thunder</b>, and <b>Mammoth</b>. He has won both the Nebula and Hugo Awards for his work.Ray Garcia-Strickland is just another Martian teenager. Sure, his parents are two of the ultra-famous original Mars colonists (as detailed in Varley's rollicking <i>Red Thunder</i>), but who cares when he's got school, girls and airboard tricks to think about? Then an object traveling at the speed of light slams into Earth, causing a massive tsunami that swamps Atlantic islands and coasts, including Ray's grandmother's Florida home. When the Garcia-Stricklands return from wading through the horrifying aftermath in search of survivors, they find that Ray's eccentric uncle, Jubal, has developed a gizmo that stops time and used it to mail himself to Mars. Drawing unabashedly on current events from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina, the author mixes space opera&#x2013;esque adventure and merriment with uncensored images of disaster areas and teenage sex. At his Heinlein-channeling best, Varley preaches the gospel of individual responsibility with all the fervor of a space-age libertarian revival preacher. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this book Mary Todd chronicles the history of this struggle for identity in the LCMS, critically examining the central--often contentious--issue of authority in relation to Scripture, ministry, and the role of women in the church. In recounting the history of the denomination, Todd uses the ministry of women as a case study to show how the LCMS has continually redefined its concept of authority in order to maintain its own historic identity. Based on oral histories and solid archival research, AUTHORITY VESTED not only explores the internal life of a significant denomination but also offers critical insights for other churches seeking to maintain their Christian distinctives in religiously pluralistic America.</p><p>Empty</p><h2>Execute Authority: A Delta Force Novel (A Delta Force Novel, 5)</h2><p><p><b>The explosive conclusion to the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling series.</b></p><p>In Dalton Fury's <i>Execute Authority</i>, Kolt &#x201c;Racer&#x201d; Raynor and his Delta Force squadron are in Greece, providing VIP security for the newly elected&#x2015;and deeply controversial&#x2015;American president on his desperate mission to hold the NATO alliance together.<br>Then, the unimaginable happens.

But the biggest bully in its history was the United States which, starting in 1964, carried on a "secret war" against Laos. By the time of the ceasefire in February 1973, Laos had become the most heavily bombed nation in the history of the world.<br><br>When renowned travel writer Dervla Murphy went to Laos in 1997, she discovered a country that had only just opened its borders to the West. What she found was a country where the people-kind, gentle, welcoming-more than compensate for everything that can go wrong. But she also discovered that the persisting problems bequeathed by its recent past are tragic and other problems threaten its immediate future. A series of chance meetings left her with a profound sense of a beautiful country and a unique culture threatened-once again-by the extreme pressures of the modern world.</p><p>Dervla Murphy was born in Ireland, where she still lives. Since 1964 she has been regularly publishing accounts of her journeys by bicycle or on foot, in the remoter areas of four continents.</p><h2>A City is Not a Tree: 50th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>In 1965, the architect and design theorist Christopher Alexander published a landmark theoretical critique of modern urban design, and by extension, modern design in general. His critique was different from others of the day in that it was not based on a social or political argument, but rather, on a structural analysis, rooted in then-emerging insights from the fields of mathematics and cognition. Here, published again on its fiftieth anniversary, is Alexander&#39;s classic text, together with new interpretive commentaries and discussions by leading theorists and practitioners. This volume is destined to become an invaluable resource for a new generation of students and practitioners.</p><p><b>Christopher Alexander</b>&nbsp;(principal author) is one of the seminal figures of 20th Century design theory, and an author of highly influential works including <i>Notes on the Synthesis of Form, A Pattern Language, The Timeless Way of Building, A New Theory of Urban Design,&nbsp;</i>and <i>The Nature of Order</i>.

In 1832 she married the Reverend William Gaskell, who became well known as the minister of the Unitarian Chapel in Manchester's Cross Street. As well as leading a busy domestic life as minister's wife and mother of four daughters, she worked among the poor, traveled frequently and wrote. Mary Barton (1848) was her first success.<br><br>Two years later she began writing for Dickens's magazine, <i>Household Words</i>, to which she contributed fiction for the next thirteen years, notably a further industrial novel, <i>North and South</i> (1855). In 1850 she met and secured the friendship of Charlotte Brontï¿½. After Charlotte's death in March 1855, Patrick Brontï¿½ chose his daughter's friend and fellow-novelist to write <i>The Life of Charlotte Brontï¿½ </i>(1857), a probing and sympathetic account, that has attained classic stature.<br><br>Elizabeth Gaskell's position as a clergyman's wife and as a successful writer introduced her to a wide circle of friends, both from the professional world of Manchester and from the larger literary world. Her output was substantial and completely professional. Dickens discovered her resilient strength of character when trying to impose his views on her as editor of Household Words. She proved that she was not to be bullied, even by such a strong-willed man.<br><br>Her later works, <i>Sylvia's Lovers</i> (1863), <i>Cousin Phillis</i> (1864) and <i>Wives and Daughters</i> (1866) reveal that she was continuing to develop her writing in new literary directions. Elizabeth Gaskell died suddenly in November 1865.</p><h2>Prodigal Summer</h2><p><p>Barbara Kingsolver, a writer praised for her "extravagantly gifted narrative voice" (<em>New York Times Book Review</em>), has created with this novel a hymn to wildness that celebrates the prodigal spirit of human nature, and of nature itself.</p><p><em>Prodigal Summer</em> weaves together three stories of human love within a larger tapestry of lives inhabiting the forested mountains and struggling small farms of southern Appalachia. At the heart of these intertwined narratives is a den of coyotes that have recently migrated into the region. Deanna Wolfe, a reclusive wildlife biologist, watches the forest from her outpost in an isolated mountain cabin where she is caught off-guard by Eddie Bondo, a young hunter who comes to invade her most private spaces and confound her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the mountain, another web of lives unfolds as Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself unexpectedly marooned in a strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land. And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly, feuding neighbors tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the complexities of a world neither of them expected.</p><p>Over the course of one humid summer, as the urge to procreate overtakes a green and profligate countryside, these characters find connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with which they necessarily share a place. Their discoveries are embedded inside countless intimate lessons of biology, the realities of small farming, and the final, urgent truth that humans are only one part of life on earth.</p><p>With the richness that characterizes Barbara Kingsolver's finest work, <em>Prodigal Summer</em> embraces pure thematic originality and demonstrates a balance of narrative and ideas that only an accomplished novelist could render so beautifully.</p>:</p><p>There is no one in contemporary literature quite like Barbara Kingsolver. Her dialogue sparkles with sassy wit and earthy poetry; her descriptions are rooted in daily life but are also on familiar terms with the eternal. With <i>Prodigal Summer</i>, she returns from the Congo to a "wrinkle on the map that lies between farms and wildness." And there, in an isolated pocket of southern Appalachia, she recounts not one but three intricate stories. <p> Exuberant, lush, riotous--the summer of the novel is "the season of extravagant procreation" in which bullfrogs carelessly lay their jellied masses of eggs in the grass, "apparently confident that their tadpoles would be able to swim through the lawn like little sperms," and in which a woman may learn to "tell time with her skin." It is also the summer in which a family of coyotes moves into the mountains above Zebulon Valley: </p><blockquote> The ghost of a creature long extinct was coming in on silent footprints, returning to the place it had once held in the complex anatomy of this forest like a beating heart returned to its body. This is what she believed she would see, if she watched, at this magical juncture: a restoration. </blockquote> The "she" is Deanna Wolfe, a wildlife biologist observing the coyotes from her isolated aerie--isolated, that is, until the arrival of a young hunter who makes her even more aware of the truth that humans are only an infinitesimal portion in the ecological balance. This truth forms the axis around which the other two narratives revolve: the story of a city girl, entomologist, and new widow and her efforts to find a place for herself; and the story of Garnett Walker and Nannie Rawley, who seem bent on thrashing out the countless intimate lessons of biology as only an irascible traditional farmer and a devotee of organic agriculture can. As Nannie lectures Garnett, "Everything alive is connected to every other by fine, invisible threads. Things you don't see can help you plenty, and things you try to control will often rear back and bite you, and that's the moral of the story." <p> Structurally, that gossamer web <i>is</i> the story: images, phrases, and events link the narratives, and these echoes are rarely obvious, always serendipitous. Kingsolver is one of those authors for whom the terrifying elegance of nature is both aesthetic wonder and source of a fierce and abiding moral vision. She may have inherited Thoreau's mantle, but she piles up riches of her own making, blending her extravagant narrative gift with benevolent concise humor. She treads the line between the sentimental and the glorious like nobody else in American literature. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p><p>Barbara Kingsolver's fifth novel is a hymn to wildness that celebrates the prodigal spirit of human nature, and of nature itself. It weaves together three stories of human love within a larger tapestry of lives amid the mountains and farms of southern Appalachia. Over the course of one humid summer, this novel's intriguing protagonists face disparate predicaments but find connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with which they necessarily share a place.</p></p><h2>Valiant Defender (Military K-9 Unit, 8)</h2><p><strong>His daughter&#x2019;s been taken...</strong><br><br>The last showdown in the Military K-9 Unit series<br><br>After relentless searching, Captain Justin Blackwood&#x2019;s closing in on the Red Rose Killer.

Father Angwin, the town&#39;s cynical priest, has lost his faith, and wants nothing more than to be left alone. Sister Philomena strains against the monotony of convent life and the pettiness of her fellow nuns. The rest of the town goes about their lives in a haze, a never-ending procession of grim, grey days stretching ahead of them.Yet all of that is about to change. A strange visitor appears one stormy night, bringing with him the hint, the taste of something entirely new, something unknown. But who is Fludd? An angel come to shake the Fetherhoughtonians from their stupor, to reawaken Father Angwin&#39;s faith, to show Philomena the nature of love? Or is he the devil himself, a shadowy wanderer of the darkest places in the human heart?Full of dry wit, compassionate characterisations and cutting insight, Fludd is a brilliant gem of a book, and one of Hilary Mantel&#39;s most original works.</p><p>Fetherhoughton, the shabby and provincial village of Hilary Mantel's fifth novel, <i>Fludd</i>, possesses a charm that is, at best, latent. The surrounding moorland is foreboding, the populace is querulous and ill-educated, and the presiding priest is an atheist. It's 1956, and drabness is general to this English backwater. Until, that is, the appearance of a disarming young priest who, apparently, has been dispatched to wrest Fetherhoughton out of its superstitious stupor. One of the novel's several wonders is that Fludd surpasses all expectations.<p> Father Angwin, Fetherhoughton's disbelieving priest, has--much to the displeasure of his superiors--grown comfortable with the entrenched, misapprehending devoutness of his flock. Fludd, who may or may not be the curate sent to deliver the wayward, exerts an immediate, if unexpected, influence. He intrigues the townspeople, flusters the church's gaggle of nuns, kindles a welcome self-examination in Father Angwin, and arouses the passion of the young and yearning Sister Philomena. A charge of possibility suddenly animates the village, accompanied by several incidents that seem midway between coincidence and miracle. Fludd, however, remains beset by an insistent disillusionment--his clarity, it seems, arcs outward only.</p><p> Mantel's cramped and pliant village is a marvel. Fetherhoughton "wrestles not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world," insists the dour headmistress, Mother Perpetua. A local tobacconist, not so trivially, just might be the devil in human garb. Fludd's gift lies in unearthing all the lovely and fearsome truths buried just beneath the surface. "The frightening thing is that life <i>is</i> fair," he observes, "but what we need... is not justice but mercy." The fruits of this conviction, in Fetherhoughton, are rebellion, self-assertion, and even scandal; but Mantel's lovely tale suggests that difficult possibility is fair compensation for a sloughed predictability. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Hilary Mantel is the author of thirteen books , including A PLACE OF GREATER SAFETY, BEYOND BLACK, and the memoir GIVING UP THE GHOST. Her two most recent novels, WOLF HALL and its sequel BRING UP THE BODIES, have both been awarded The Man Booker Prize - an unprecedented achievement.</p><h2>Ninja and Their Secret Fighting Art</h2><p>In feudal Japan, ninja warriors were credited with supernatural powers of invisibility and ways of learning any secret. They also were feared for their skill in espionage and assassination. Behind these legends is the reality of an ancient, sophisticated, highly systematic martial art: ninjutsu. Perhaps the least understood martial art of Japan, ninjutsu emphasizes naturalness of movement, responsiveness to one's adversary, and total practicality. Women as well as men were trained in this obscure deadly art. As its form crystallized, practitioners established an organized system for maintaining absolute secrecy. Now, all aspects of ninjutsu are revealed in this remarkable book written by the first American trained as a ninja.<br></p><p>Stephen K. Hayes has spent over one-third of his life practicing and teaching the Oriental fighting arts. He is the first American ever accepted as a personal student by the master of the last historically unbroken ninjutsu tradition in Japan. Stephen K. Hayes, called the "Father of American Ninjutsu" by Inside Kung Fu wrote this classic. <br> <br><b>Stephen K.

The unabridged audiobook, narrated by George Guidall (<i>The Cat Who Sang for the Birds</i>, <i>The Inner Sanctum</i>, <i>The Legacy</i>) draws the listener in with a crisp, methodical vocal presentation. Guidall portrays each character with a convincingly distinct voice, accurately impersonating the characters' intonations and verbal habits. The interaction between characters is both conversational and believable.<p> We first meet Ruth Cole in the summer of 1958 when she walks in on her mother having sex with 16-year-old Eddie O'Hare, the assistant to Ruth's alcoholic father. The death of Ruth's older brothers (years before she was born) turns her mother, Marion, into a zombie who is unable to love her surviving daughter. Ted Cole is a semisuccessful writer and illustrator of disturbingly creepy children's novels. His womanizing habits prove he's "as deceitful as a damaged condom," but he remains the only stable figure in Ruth's life. The tempestuous tale fast-forwards to the year 1990 when Ruth's soaring writing career is faring far better than her lackluster love life. The final segment of the novel ends in 1995 when 41-year-old Ruth is ready to fall in love for the first time.</p><p> This profoundly absorbing story expresses the depths of misery and the healing power of love. Irving writes as a true storyteller, and Guidall executes the narrative with vigor and enthusiasm. (Running time: 24.5 hours, 14 cassettes) <i>--Gina Kaysen</i></p>"Deeply affecting . . .

As Judith Duerk powerfully shows, the world is crying out for a developed Feminine voice, a voice that can mediate, once again, the ancient values of the Feminine. These are values of interiority and of the sacredness of the earth, that honor the privacy of individual process; values of the deeper Self held within us all. Many women experience a battle within themselves between the critical, dismissing voice of their masculine side and the interior, self-sustaining voice of their feminine side. Without coming to terms and seeking balance with our masculine side, our feminine side can never reach its full potential.

In 1955, fourteen-year-old Tony found himself entangled with a married Catholic woman. In Cold War England, where Catholicism was the subject of news stories and Graham Greene bestsellers, Tony was whisked off by the woman&#x2019;s husband to see a priest and be saved.<br><br>Yet what he found was a far cry from the priests he&#x2019;d known at Catholic school, where boys were beaten with belts or set upon by dogs. Instead, he met Father Joe, a gentle, stammering, ungainly Benedictine who never used the words &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; or &#x201c;guilt,&#x201d; who believed that God was in everyone and that &#x201c;the only sin was selfishness.&#x201d; During the next forty years, as his life and career drastically ebbed and flowed, Tony discovered that his visits to Father Joe remained the one constant in his life&#x2014;the relationship that, in the most serious sense, saved it.<br><br>From the fifties and his adolescent desire to join an abbey himself; to the sixties, when attending Cambridge and seeing the satire of <i>Beyond the Fringe</i> convinced him to change the world with laughter, not prayer; to the seventies and successful stints as an original editor of <i>National Lampoon</i> and a writer of <i>Lemmings</i>, the off-Broadway smash that introduced John Belushi and Chevy Chase; to professional disaster after co-creating the legendary English series <i>Spitting Image</i>; from drinking to drugs, from a failed first marriage to a successful second and the miracle of parenthood&#x2014;the years only deepened Tony&#x2019;s need for the wisdom of his other and more real father, creating a bond that could not be broken, even by death.<br><br>A startling departure for this acclaimed satirist, <b>Father Joe</b> is a sincere account of how Tony Hendra learned to love. It&#x2019;s the story of a whole generation looking for a way back from mockery and irony, looking for its own Father Joe, and a testament to one of the most charismatic mentors in modern literature.</p><p><i>How I met Father Joe. I was fourteen and having an affair with a married woman.</i> These are the opening lines to the first chapter of this outstanding memoir by former <i>National Lampoon</i> Editor Tony Hendra. How could we resist diving into this deliciously satisfying story about a lifelong mentorship with Dom Joseph Warrilow, a.k.a. Father Joe? After the devout Catholic husband catches the illicit couple in the kitchen, the husband does not attack Hendra. Instead he decides the young boy needs salvation. Amazingly, the husband leads Hendra to the one man who could save his soul: Father Joe. This is a tribute to a spiritual mentor, written in an easygoing, guy-talk style. It is no small feat to be brilliantly funny, ruthlessly honest, and spiritually profound at the same time, but Hendra has the winning combo. For more than 40 years Hendra would return to this mesmerizing old soul to tell him everything---from the details of his first sexual encounter, through questioning the social value of satire, to his crisis in faith after losing two children through miscarriages. But it's not just the North Star wisdom of Father Joe that captivates readers; it is the chance to follow Hendra as he gradually matures into a humble and spiritually solid man who can still crack a wicked good joke. Such a gift.

It is also a key antidote to the widespread problem of "White Elephant" art-- big, swaggering "masterpiece art" self-consciously striving for greatness. In this book, artists, historians, and critics dive deep into art that forgoes such ambition in order to attend to the pleasures and problems of the everyday. The book is anchored by an essay by editor Helen Molesworth and features four contemporary commissioned artists' projects that exemplify "Termite Art," an interview with filmmaker Jean-Pierre Gorin, and a carefully selected collection of historical essays by and about Farber that functions as a reader on the subject.<br><b>Copublished by The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and DelMonico Books</b></p><p>HELEN MOLESWORTH is Chief Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

These works are shown together with others from the later 60s and 70s to chart the early career of this highly influential but--especially in the US--all-too-little-known artist. Riley&#39;s dynamically abstract paintings from the 1960s and 1970s long ago secured her a permanent place in the history of postwar art. Despite this widespread acclaim, Riley&#39;s work has been exhibited in the US only on a few occasions. In Reconnaissance, the artist&#39;s first solo exhibition to originate in the US in decades, the public will be able to examine a selection from Riley&#39;s compelling body of early work. Additionally, Riley has executed a wall drawing for Dia&#39;s galleries, which is documented here.</p><p>Bridget Riley was born in 1931 in London, where she currently lives and works. Educated at Goldsmiths College of Art and at the Royal College of Art in London, she has exhibited widely since her first solo exhibition in 1962. Among numerous group exhibitions, Riley participated in the 1968 Venice Biennial--where she won the international prize--and the 1986 Venice Biennial, as well as Documenta 4 in 1968 and Documenta 6 in 1977. Retrospectives of her work toured Europe and the world during the 70s, and she has exhibited work at institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Tate Britain, London.&#34;No painter, dead or alive, has ever made us more aware of our eyes than Bridget Riley.&#34;</p><h2>The odyssey of C.H.

Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><br><br><em>Present Day</em><br><br>"Stay in the car," Sierra McKettrick told her seven-year-old son, Liam.<br><br>He fixed her with an owlish gaze, peering through the lenses of his horn-rimmed glasses. "I want to see the graves, too," he told her, and put a mittened hand to the passenger-side door handle to make his point.<br><br>"Another time," she answered firmly. Part of her knew it was irrational to think a visit to the cemetery could provoke an asthma attack, but when it came to Liam's health, she was taking no chances.<br><br>A brief stare-down ensued, and Sierra prevailed, but barely.<br><br>"It's not fair," Liam said, yet he sounded resigned. He didn't normally give up so easily, but they'd just driven almost nonstop all the way from Florida to northern Arizona, and he was tired.<br><br>"Welcome to the real world," Sierra replied. She set the emergency brake, left the engine running with the heat on High, and got out of the ancient station wagon she'd bought on credit years before.<br><br>Standing ankle-deep in a patch of ragged snow, she took in her surroundings. Ordinary people were buried in churchyards and public cemeteries when they died, she reflected, feeling peevish. The McKettricks were a law unto themselves, living <em>or </em>dead. They weren't content with a mere plot, like other families. Oh, no. They had to have a place all their own, with a view. And what a view it was.<br><br>Shoving her hands into the pockets of her cloth coat, which was nearly as decrepit as her car, Sierra turned to survey the Triple M Ranch, sprawling in every direction, well beyond the range of her vision. Red mesas and buttes, draped in a fine lacing of snow. Copses of majestic white oaks, growing at intervals along a wide and shining stream. Expanses of pastureland, and even the occasional cactus, a stranger to the high country, a misplaced wayfarer, there by mistake.<br><br>Like her.<br><br>A flash of resentment rose suddenly within Sierra, and a moment or two passed before she recognized the emotion for what it was: not her own opinion, but that of her late father, Hank Breslin.<br><br>When it came to the McKettricks, Sierra <em>had </em>no opinions that she could honestly claim, because she didn't know these people, except by reputation.<br><br>She'd taken their name for one reason and one reason only&#x2014;because that was part of the deal. Liam needed health care, and she couldn't provide it. Eve McKettrick&#x2014;Sierra's biological mother&#x2014;had set up a medical trust fund for her grandson, but there were strings attached.<br><br><em>With the McKettricks, </em>she heard her father say, as surely as if he were standing there beside her, <em>there are always strings attached.</em><br><br>"Be quiet," Sierra said, out loud. She was grateful for Eve's help, and if she had to take the McKettrick name and live on the Triple M Ranch for a year to meet the conditions, so be it. It wasn't as if she had anyplace better to go.<br><br>Resolutely she approached the cemetery entrance, walked under the ornate metal archway forming the word "McKettrick" in graceful cursive.<br><br>A life-size bronze statue of a man on horseback, broad-shouldered and imposing, with a bandanna at his throat and a six-gun riding on his hip, took center stage.<br><br>Angus McKettrick, the patriarch. The founder of the Triple M, and the dynasty. Sierra knew little about him, but as she looked up into that hard, determined face, shaped by the rigors of life in the nineteenth century, she felt a kinship.<br><br><em>Ruthless old bastard, </em>said the voice of Hank Breslin. <em>That's where McKettricks get their arrogance. From him.</em><br><br>"Be quiet," Sierra repeated, thrusting her hands deeper into her coat pockets. She stood in silence for a long moment, listening to the rattle-throated hum of the station wagon's engine, the lonely cry of a nearby bird, the thrum of blood in her ears. A piney scent spiced the air.<br><br>Sierra turned, saw the marble angels marking the graves of Angus McKettrick's wives&#x2014;Georgia, mother of Rafe, Kade and Jeb. Concepcion, mother of Kate.<br><br><em>Look for Holt and Lorelei, </em>Eve had told her, the last time they'd spoken over the telephone. <em>That's our part of the family.</em><br><br>Sierra caught sight of other bronze statues, smaller than Angus's but no less impressive in their detail. They were works of art, museum pieces, and if they hadn't been solidly anchored in cement, they probably would have been stolen. It said something about the McKettrick legend, she supposed, that there had been no vandalism in this lonely, wind-blown place.<br><br>Jeb McKettrick, the youngest of the brothers, was represented by a cowboy with his six-gun drawn; his wife, Chloe, by a slender woman in pioneer dress, shading her eyes with one hand and smiling. Their children, grandchildren, great- and a few great-great-grandchildren surrounded them, their costly headstones laid out in neat rows, like the streets of a western town.<br><br>Next was Kade McKettrick, easy in his skin, wearing a six-shooter, like his brother, but with an open book in his hand. His wife, Mandy, wore trousers, a loose-fitting shirt, boots and a hat, and held a shotgun. Like Chloe, she was smiling. Judging by the number of other graves around theirs, these two had also been prolific parents.<br><br>The statue of Rafe McKettrick revealed a big, powerfully built man with a stubborn set to his jaw. His bride, Emmeline, stood close against his side; their arms were linked and she rested her head against the outside of his upper arm.<br><br>Sierra smiled. Again, their progeny was plentiful.<br><br>The last statue brought up an unexpected surge of emotion in Sierra. Here, then, was Holt, half brother to Rafe, Kade and Jeb, and to Kate. In his long trail coat, he looked both handsome and tough. A pair of very detailed ammunition belts criss-crossed his chest, and the badge pinned to his wide lapel read Texas Ranger.<br><br>Sierra stared into those bronze eyes and, once again, felt something stir deep inside her. I came from this man, she thought. We've got the same DNA.<br><br>Liam gave a jarring blast of the car horn, impatient to get to the ranch house that would be their home for the next twelve months.<br><br>Sierra waved in acknowledgment but moved on to the statue of Lorelei. She was mounted on a mule, long, lace-trimmed skirts spilling on either side of her impossibly small waist, face shadowed, not by a sunbonnet but by a man's hat. Her spirited gaze rested lovingly on her husband, Holt.<br><br>Liam laid on the horn.<br><br>Fearing he might decide to take the wheel and drive to the ranch house on his own, Sierra turned reluctantly from the markers and followed a path littered with pine needles and the dead leaves of the six towering white oaks that shared the space, heading back to the car.<br><br>Back to her son.<br><br>"Are all the McKettricks <em>dead?</em>" Liam asked, when Sierra settled into the driver's seat and fastened the belt.<br><br>"No," Sierra answered, waiting for some stray part of herself to finish meandering among those graves, making the acquaintance of ancestors, and catch up. <em>"We're </em>McKettricks, and we're not dead. Neither is your grandmother, or Meg." She knew there were cousins, too, descended from Rafe, Kade and Jeb, but it was too big a subject to explain to a seven-year-old boy. Besides, she was still trying to square them all away in her own mind.<br><br>"I thought my name was Liam <em>Breslin," </em>the little boy said practically.<br><br>It should have been Liam Douglas, Sierra thought, remembering her first and only lover. As always, when Liam's father, Adam, came to mind, she felt a pang, a complicated mixture of passion, sorrow and helpless fury. She and Adam had never been married, so she'd given Liam her maiden name.<br><br>"We're McKettricks now," Sierra said with a sigh. "You'll understand when you're older."<br><br>She backed the car out carefully, keenly aware of the steep descent on all sides, and made the wide turn that would take them back on to the network of dirt roads bisecting the Triple M.<br><br>"I can understand <em>now," </em>Liam asserted, having duly pondered the matter in his solemn way. "After all, I'm <em>gifted."</em><br><br>"You may be gifted," Sierra replied, concentrating on her driving, "but you're still seven."<br><br>"Do I get to be a cowboy and ride bucking broncs and stuff like that?"<br><br>Sierra suppressed a shudder. "No," she said.<br><br>"That bites," Liam answered, folding his arms and settling deeper into the heavy nylon coat she'd bought him on the road, when they'd reached the first of the cold-weather states. "What's the good of living on a ranch if you can't be a cowboy?"<br><br>The elderly station wagon banged into the yard, bald tires crunching half-thawed gravel, and came to an obstreperous stop. Travis Reid paused behind the horse trailer hitched to Jesse McKettrick's mud-splattered black truck, pushed his hat to the back of his head with one leather-gloved finger and grinned, waiting for something to fall off the rig. Nothing did, which just went to prove that the age of miracles was not past.<br><br>Jesse appeared at the back of the trailer, leading old Baldy by his halter rope. "Who's that?" he asked, squinting in the wintry late afternoon sunshine.<br><br>Travis spared him no more than a glance. "A long-lost relative of yours, unless I miss my guess," he said easily.<br><br>The station wagon belched some smoke and died. Travis figured it for a permanent condition. He looked on with interest as a good-looking woman climbed out from behind the wheel, looked the old car over, and gave the driver's-side door a good kick with her right foot.<br><br>She was a McKettrick, all right. Of the female persuasion, too.<br><br>Jesse left Baldy standing to jump down from the bed of the trailer and lower the ramp to the ground. "Meg's half sister?" he asked. "The one who grew up in Mexico with her crazy, drunken father?"<br><br>"Reckon so," Travis said. He and Meg communicated regularly, most often by email, and she'd filled him in on Sierra as far as she could. Nobody in the family knew her very well, including her mother, Eve, so the information was sparse. She had a seven-year-old son&#x2014;now getting out of the car&#x2014;and she'd been serving cocktails in Florida for the last few years, and that was about all Travis knew about her. As Meg's caretaker and resident horse trainer, not to mention her friend, Travis had stocked the cupboards and refrigerator, made sure the temperamental furnace was working and none of the plumbing had frozen, and started up Meg's Blazer every day, just to make sure it was running.<br><br>From the looks of that station wagon, it was a good thing he'd followed the boss-lady's orders.<br><br>"You gonna help me with this horse," Jesse asked testily, "or just stand there gawking?"<br><br>Travis chuckled. "Right now," he said, "I'm all for gawking."<br><br>Sierra McKettrick was tall and slender, with short, gleaming brown hair the color of a good chestnut horse. Her eyes were huge and probably blue, though she was still a stride or two too far away for him to tell.<br><br>Jesse swore and stomped back up the ramp, making plenty of noise as he did so. Like most of the McKettricks, Jesse was used to getting his way, and while he was a known womanizer, he'd evidently dismissed Sierra out of hand. After all, she was a blood relative&#x2014;no sense driving his herd into <em>that </em>canyon.<br><br>Travis took a step toward the woman and the boy, who was staring at him with his mouth open.<br><br>"Is this Meg's house?" Sierra asked.<br><br>"Yes," Travis said, putting out his hand, pulling it back to remove his work gloves, and offering it again. "Travis Reid," he told her.<br><br>"Sierra Bres&#x2014;McKettrick," she replied. Her grip was firm. And her eyes were definitely blue. The kind of blue that pierces something in a man's middle. She smiled, but tentatively. Somewhere along the line, she'd learned to be sparing with her smiles. "This is my son, Liam."<br><br>"Howdy," Liam said, squaring his small shoulders.<br><br>Travis grinned. "Howdy," he replied. Meg had said the boy had health problems, but he looked pretty sound to Travis.<br><br>"That sure is an ugly horse," Liam announced, pointing towards the trailer.<br><br>Travis turned. Baldy stood spraddle-footed, midway down the ramp, a miserable gray specimen of a critter with pink eyes and liver-colored splotches all over his mangy hide.<br><br>"Sure is," Travis agreed, and glowered at Jesse for palming the animal off on him. It was like him to pull off a dramatic last-minute rescue, then leave the functional aspects of the problem to somebody else.<br><br>Jesse flashed a grin, and for a moment, Travis felt territorial, wanted to set himself between Sierra and her boy, the pair of them, and one of his oldest friends. He felt off balance, somehow, as though he'd been ambushed. What the hell was <em>that </em>all about?<br><br>"Is that a buckin' bronc?" Liam asked, venturing a step toward Baldy.<br><br>Sierra reached out quickly, caught hold of the fur-trimmed hood on the kid's coat and yanked him back. Cold sunlight glinted off the kid's glasses, making his eyes invisible.<br><br>Jesse laughed. "Back in the day," he said, "Baldy was a rodeo horse. Cowboys quivered in their boots when they drew him to ride. Now, as you can see, he's a little past his prime."<br><br>"And you would be&#x2014;?" Sierra asked, with a touch of coolness to her tone. Maybe she was the one woman out of a thousand who could see Jesse McKettrick for what he was&#x2014;a good-natured case of very bad news. "Your cousin Jesse."<br><br>Sierra sized him up, took in his battered jeans, work shirt, sheepskin coat and very expensive boots. "Descended from...?"<br><br>The McKettricks talked like that. Every one of them could trace their lineage back to old Angus, by a variety of paths, and while there would be hell to pay if anybody riled them as a bunch, they mostly kept to their own branch of the family tree.<br><br>"Jeb," Jesse said.<br><br>Sierra nodded.<br><br>Liam's attention remained fixed on the horse. "Can I ride him?"<br><br>"Sure," Jesse replied.<br><br>"No way," said Sierra, at exactly the same moment.<br><br>Travis felt sorry for the kid, and it must have shown in his face, because Sierra's gaze narrowed on him.<br><br>"We've had a long trip," she said. "I guess we'll just go inside."<br><br>"Make yourselves at home," Travis said, gesturtng toward the house. "Don't worry about your bags. Jesse and I'll carry them in for you."<br><br>She considered, probably wondering if she'd be obligated in any way if she agreed, then nodded. Catching Liam by the hood of his coat again, she got him turned from the horse and hustled him toward the front door.<br><br>"Too bad we're kin," Jesse said, following Sierra with his eyes.<br><br>"Too bad," Travis agreed mildly, though privately he didn't believe it was such a bad thing at all.<br><br></p><h2>Hunger of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez</h2><p>A personal account of what it has cost the author, nonmonetarily, to be educated beyond his origins as the son of Mexican immigrants rejects affirmative action and bilingualism as benign errors</p><p><i>Hunger Of Memory</i> is the story of a Mexican-American Richard Rodriguez, who begins his schooling in Sacramento, California, knowing just 50 words of English and concludes his university studies in the stately quiet of the reading room of the British Museum.<p> Here is the poignant journey is a "minority student" who pays the cost of his social assimilation and academic success with a painful alienation -- from his past, his parents, his culture -- and so describes the high price of "making it" in middle class America.</p><p> Provocative in its positions on affirmative action and bilingual education, <i>Hunger Of Memory</i> is a powerful political statement, a profound study of the importance of language... and the moving, intimate portrait of a boy struggling to become a man.</p><p> "Arresting...Splendidly written intellectual autobiography." -- <i>Boston Globe</i> </p><p> "Superb autobiographical essay...

M.</h2><p>In 1953, 27-year-old Henry Gustave Molaison underwent an experimental psychosurgical&#x201d; procedure a targeted lobotomy in an effort to alleviate his debilitating epilepsy. The outcome was unexpected when Henry awoke, he could no longer form new memories, and for the rest of his life would be trapped in the moment. <br><br>But Henry's tragedy would prove a gift to humanity. As renowned neuroscientist Suzanne Corkin explains in <i>Permanent Present Tense</i>, she and her colleagues brought to light the sharp contrast between Henry's crippling memory impairment and his preserved intellect. This new insight that the capacity for remembering is housed in a specific brain area revolutionized the science of memory. The case of Henry known only by his initials H. M. until his death in 2008 stands as one of the most consequential and widely referenced in the spiraling field of neuroscience. Corkin and her collaborators worked closely with Henry for nearly fifty years, and in <i>Permanent Present Tense</i> she tells the incredible story of the life and legacy of this intelligent, quiet, and remarkably good-humored man. Henry never remembered Corkin from one meeting to the next and had only a dim conception of the importance of the work they were doing together, yet he was consistently happy to see her and always willing to participate in her research. His case afforded untold advances in the study of memory, including the discovery that even profound amnesia spares some kinds of learning, and that different memory processes are localized to separate circuits in the human brain.

Today he is Samuel Hunter, a successful Santa Barbara insurance salesman with a Mercedes, a condo, and a hollow, invented life. Then one day, shortly after his thirty-fifth birthday, destiny offers him the dangerous gift of love -- in the exquisite form of Calliope Kincaid -- and a curse in the unheralded appearance of an ancient Indian god by the name of Coyote. Coyote, the trickster, has arrived to transform tranquillity into chaos, to reawaken the mystical storyteller within Sam ... and to seriously screw up his existence in the process.</p></p><p>This is an accelerating comedy with shadows setting off the wry, polished humor. Trickster deities thrive on contrariety, which is why one finds them bringing life into dead landscapes and disorder into order. A Santa Barbara insurance salesman&#39;s too-tidily-contained lifestyle, far from the Crow reservation he grew up on, is an irresistible target for Coyote, who wants to make sure his chosen people don&#39;t forget him. Coyote descends on Sam Hunter like one of Job&#39;s plagues, albeit a charmingly disingenuous one. &#34;Why me? Why not someone who believes?&#34; asks Sam, suffering from god-induced chaos. &#34;This is more fun,&#34; says Coyote. He&#39;s right.<p>Christopher Moore is the author of thirteen previous novels, including <em>Lamb</em>, <em>The Stupidest Angel</em>, <em>Fool</em>, <em>Sacrï¿½ Bleu</em>, and <em>A Dirty Job</em>.

For eight decades, he has blazed new trails across a dazzling variety of creative fields. While his psychedelic, visionary films have been celebrated by the likes of John Lennon, Marina Abramovic, and Kanye West, his novels&#x2014;praised throughout Latin America in the same breath as those of Gabriel Garcï¿½a Mï¿½rquez&#x2014;have remained largely unknown in the English-speaking world. Until now.<br> <br><i>Where the Bird Sings Best</i> tells the fantastic story of the Jodorowskys&#x2019; emigration from Ukraine to Chile amidst the political and cultural upheavals of the 19th and 20th centuries. Like <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, Jodorowsky&#x2019;s book transforms family history into heroic legend: incestuous beekeepers hide their crime with a living cloak of bees, a czar fakes his own death to live as a hermit amongst the animals, a devout grandfather confides only in the ghost of a wise rabbi, a transgender ballerina with a voracious sexual appetite holds a would-be saint in thrall. Kaleidoscopic, exhilarating, and erotic, <i>Where the Bird Sings Best</i> expands the classic immigration story to mythic proportions.</p><p><b>Alejandro Jodorowsky</b> was born to Ukrainian Jewish immigrants in Tocopilla, Chile. From an early age, he became interested in mime and theater; at the age of 23, he left for Paris to pursue the arts, and has lived there ever since. A friend and companion of Fernando Arrabal and Roland Topor, he founded the Panic movement and has directed several classic films of this style, including <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, <i>El Topo</i> and <i>Santa Sangre</i>. A mime artist, specialist in the art of tarot, and prolific author, he has written novels, poetry, short stories, essays, and over thirty successful comic books, working with such highly regarded comic book artists as Moebius and Bess. Restless Books will be publishing three of Jodorowsky's best-known books for the first time in English: <i>Donde mejor canta un pï¿½jaro</i> (<i>Where the Bird Sings Best</i>), <i>El niï¿½o del jueves negro</i> (<i>The Son of Black Thursday</i>), and <i>Albina y los hombres perro</i> (<i>Albina and the Dog Men</i>).<br> <br><b>Alfred MacAdam</b> is professor of Latin American literature at Barnard College-Columbia University. He has translated works by Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, Juan Carlos Onetti, Josï¿½ Donoso, and Jorge Volpi among others. He recently published an essay on the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa included in the <i>Cambridge Companion to Autobiography</i>."Jodorowsky is today&#x2019;s true Renaissance man&#x2014;a master of many mediums that all point directly towards a towering and imaginative vision replete with profound insights into the real by way of the surreal. The stories told in <i>Where the Bird Sings Best</i> contain deep moral lessons, giving his mythic immigration story the feel of a modern day <i>Sefer-ha-Aggadah</i>&#x2014;the classic collection of Jewish folk tales drawn from the Mishnah, Midrash and Talmud.

When you walk into a room or down the street, even without thinking about it, you immediately take note of clothing clues and judge the wearers accordingly. You can usually tell at a glance whether a person is rich, poor, or somewhere in the middle. Often, you can even guess what someone does for a living&#x2014;the messenger with his pants legs rolled up, the businessman in his suit.<br> <br>And yet, it&#x2019;s rare that people think about what their own clothes signify about their place in the world or their priorities. Clothes are self-expression. If you have a limited range of outfits&#x2014;say, only capri pants and T-shirts&#x2014;it&#x2019;s as though you have a limited range of words in your vocabulary.<br> <br>While many historians concern themselves with the dress of indigenous civilizations, the work of certain designers, or with very specific periods in fashion, I am most interested in the clothes we wear right here and now and how various looks came into vogue. My focus in this book is on Western fashion, with a particular emphasis on America. I will look, piece by piece, at the items most Americans have in their closets and ask, &#x201c;Do you know where this garment comes from&#x2014;before Old Navy?&#x201d;<br> <br><i>This old thing?,</i> you may think.<br> <br>My answer is yes. Even that ratty band T-shirt has a fascinating history that goes back far before the Steel Wheels tour. While American fashion is often vilified as sloppy or as the poor relation of Parisian couture, I find it full of surprises, beauty, and history. And I love exploring the ways in which and the reasons why clothing changes over time.<br> <br>Before writing this book, I considered myself to be something of a fashion expert. I was an educator for twenty-nine years, during which I loved learning as much as I loved teaching. And yet, while working on this book, my learning curve has so profoundly accelerated and my body of knowledge has so increased that I feel as though I&#x2019;ve gone through graduate school again! The research required was simultaneously daunting and exhilarating. Every day brought exclamations of surprise and wonder.<br><br>Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis the XVI, in a gown that typified the excess of the French court.<br><br>For example, I have always maintained that fashion is all about context&#x2014;societal, cultural, historic, economic, and political. But even I was shocked by what a massive fashion shift occurred during the French Revolution. The sumptuous gowns during the reigns of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI became so dazzlingly vast and the wigs and headdresses so loftily high that architecture, interiors, and furniture all had to be reimagined. Then, in a moment, these dramatic silhouettes suddenly vanished, along with the royal court. In their place were dresses so basic that they resembled the simplest of nightgowns. These unbleached cotton garments had no infrastructure and no embellishments. It just goes to show: fashion and history are inextricably linked!<br> <br>Why is it, you may ask, that the lion&#x2019;s share of fashion history books examine fashion in the Western world? The answer is simple: for centuries clothing in the Western world has changed and evolved, while clothing in the East has remained unchanged. The Indian sari; the Chinese cheongsam, or qipao; the Korean <i>hanbok;</i> the Japanese kimono have all stayed the same for thousands of years. Their evolution is in the textile. The kimono, for example, is belted with an obi that must be 12 inches wide and 4.38 yards long. How&#x2019;s that for prescriptive?<br> <br>There are many examples of beautiful clothes in these parts of the world, and their histories are also fascinating, but there isn&#x2019;t the same level of evolution. For this same reason, I&#x2019;ll also put aside discussion of the European folk tradition. Regional peasant clothing is remarkable in its consistency. There is a Bronze Age clay figurine found in Romania of a woman whose costume bears an uncanny resemblance to a Bulgarian folk costume worn in the early twentieth century. That&#x2019;s thirty-five hundred years in which the dress barely changed!1 But it&#x2019;s a dead end for us if we&#x2019;re talking about how fashion evolved to where we are today.<br> <br>When you think, by contrast, about what happened to the toga, it&#x2019;s pretty mind-blowing. The toga was just a piece of cloth that you draped around your body to preserve your modesty. The original toga was floor-length, and it was the apparel of the aristocracy. Wealthy Greeks and Romans wore it when gliding around rooms.<br> <br>Outside, the ground was filthy, so the toga became shorter once Romans started to wear it beyond their marble-floored villas. Then, of course, people noticed that the bottom half of the garment became dirtier more quickly than the top, so the toga eventually evolved into separates . . . and today into both modern sportswear and the wrap dress.<br><br>In the 1920s, the drapiness of the ancient toga returned for the first time in centuries (although not usually as explicitly as in this 1920 photograph!).<br><br>When I take students to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I love to lead them through the museum chronologically, because that way they come to understand the evolution of ideas. Even more exciting: they start to anticipate what may come next. Everything comes from somewhere, for some purpose. That&#x2019;s why I love Renaissance painting. Every element has meaning, from a sparrow to a lily. And that&#x2019;s true of fashion, too.<br> <br>In this book I will guide you age by age through fashion&#x2019;s evolution from cavemen&#x2019;s animal hides to the latest runway collections. Just as my students cheer when paintings with perspective emerge in the Met&#x2019;s collection, I hope this book&#x2019;s readers will gasp as they see how Saxon underwear begat the cargo capri pant (and why that&#x2019;s the worst fashion trend in America today), or how the traditional Roman sandal, strapped up the leg to stay on in the heat of battle, evolved into the flip-flop worn by nearly every twenty-first-century college student.<br> <br>High, narrow heels, by contrast, have always signified wealth&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no need to walk anywhere if you&#x2019;re of such a high class that you are carried around in a sedan chair or&#x2014;in modern times&#x2014;a car. You can wear Jimmy Choos when you&#x2019;re just stepping out of the back of a limo and onto a red carpet and don&#x2019;t need to worry about getting your heel stuck in sidewalk gratings or cracks. In the 1990s, we had chunky heels, partly because it was not as fashionable to be rich during the grunge era.<br> <br>Things happen for a reason and only have staying power for a reason. Some fashion historians argue that every change in fashion reflects a focus on a new erogenous zone and that changes in necklines and hemlines stem from a desire to stave off sexual boredom.<br> <br>Fashion innovations vanish quickly if they aren&#x2019;t sustainable&#x2014;some garments return, some die out completely, and some never seem to leave at all. As I write this, some of the hippest young people in Brooklyn are running around in little tunic rompers nearly identical to those worn by soldiers in ancient Greece. Both groups value the freedom of movement such a garment provides, even if one is running on a battlefield and the other is scampering off to an indie rock show.<br><br>Jayne Mansfield shows off her high heels. A craze for clear shoes brought about the invention of sandal-foot&#x2014;or sheer-toe and heel&#x2014;panty hose.<br><br>And yet, most people are unaware of our nation&#x2019;s political history&#x2014;much less its fashion legacy. We&#x2019;re living in a woefully a-historical age. Often when I asked my students at Parsons to tell me when World War II was, no one could. It&#x2019;s especially galling that so few young designers know about American fashion history because there aren&#x2019;t even very many years to learn about! Until World War II, we were a nation of copiers. During the war, we couldn&#x2019;t copy from Europe, because the couture houses had closed. Along came American innovators like Claire McCardell and Norman Norell, representing two different aesthetics&#x2014;sportswear and evening wear, respectively&#x2014;and American creativity in fashion was born. The 1940s weren&#x2019;t that long ago, but even fashion students at some of the best schools are ignorant of what a huge shift occurred in the field during that era.<br> <br>Meanwhile, I could frequently tell which students had no historical sense simply by looking at how derivative their designs were. They kept thinking they were inventing the wheel with every new design because they hadn&#x2019;t bothered to inform themselves that the wheel already had a long and happy history. This situation always reminds me of the Phoenicians. They made reproductions of Egyptian and Greek art, but they couldn&#x2019;t read hieroglyphs, so the writing they reproduced was all gibberish. They&#x2019;d never seen a chariot in real life, so the scenes they depicted on vases showed someone standing in a little cart without the horses attached. Borrowing from cultures without understanding the fundamentals can yield some pretty weird and wholly illogical perversions.<br> <br>I am especially concerned that American fashion not be forgotten. Once, I met the head of a hot design school in the Netherlands, and she expressed nothing but contempt for American design&#x2014;an attitude I find very offensive when espoused by Europeans and downright tragic when held by Americans. When I look through <i>Project Runway</i> applications, I am always struck by how few American designers are cited in the influences section. Invariably, the only designers they name are Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, and Coco Chanel&#x2014;often misspelled &#x201c;Channel.&#x201d; You only rarely see American designers listed. If you do, it&#x2019;s usually Donna Karan. (I don&#x2019;t understand why people don&#x2019;t write Michael Kors&#x2014;even just in their own political self-interest.)<br><br>Claire McCardell is one of the all-time great American designers.<br><br>When it comes to fashion, we clearly need to become more patriotic and defend our own country&#x2019;s tradition as a worthy extension of Western fashion history. I always wonder how these people who are trying to be the &#x201c;next great American fashion designer&#x201d; can fail to appreciate any of the historically great American designers. I&#x2019;m thinking of Pauline Trigï¿½re, Claire McCardell, Norman Norell, Bill Blass, Rudi Gernreich, Bonnie Cashin, Larry Aldrich, Geoffrey Beene . . . . The list goes on and on! Instead, many young designers I meet idolize the Antwerp Six, early-eighties graduates of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, including Dries van Noten and Ann Demeulemeester&#x2014;and if people can&#x2019;t spell &#x201c;Chanel,&#x201d; they <i>really</i> cannot spell &#x201c;Demeulemeester.&#x201d;<br> <br>While I&#x2019;m naming names, a quick note on terminology: there has been an assault in certain academic circles on the word &#x201c;fashion.&#x201d; I am unsettled by people&#x2019;s dislike of the word&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not the other F-word! Some TV executives once suggested I use &#x201c;style&#x201d; instead, because &#x201c;fashion&#x201d; is elitist. But the elite don&#x2019;t always like the word, either. A certain prestigious art school in the Northeast uses the phrase &#x201c;apparel design&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;fashion design.&#x201d; I was once on campus as part of an external review committee. In our exit interview, I told the president: &#x201c;I believe the reason the program eschews the term &#x2018;fashion&#x2019; is because this curriculum has nothing to do with fashion. It doesn&#x2019;t address the marketplace. It doesn&#x2019;t teach fashion history. It&#x2019;s basically a dressmaking school. I was bored out of my skull. No one here is interested in innovation. Don&#x2019;t you want your graduates to change the world?&#x201d; (And that, dear readers, is one way to exempt yourself from future external review committees.)<br> <br>I love the word &#x201c;fashion.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m using it in the title of this book. Fashion is about change and about creating clothes within a historical context. To me, dismissing fashion as silly or unimportant seems like a denial of history and frequently a show of sexism&#x2014;as if something that&#x2019;s traditionally a concern of women isn&#x2019;t valid as a field of academic inquiry. When the Parsons fashion department was founded in 1906, it was called &#x201c;costume design,&#x201d; because fashion was then a verb: to fashion. But the word &#x201c;fashion&#x201d; has evolved to mean something much more profound, and those who resist it seem to me to be on the wrong side of history.<br> <br>American fashion designers are doing so much in spite of severe disadvantages in the global fashion world. First of all, they have always needed to make money from their work. They&#x2019;re not subsidized by the textile mills, as the French are. And they haven&#x2019;t enjoyed any of the design piracy protections that exist in Europe. It&#x2019;s hard to be a designer in America! It takes a lot of courage and feistiness. In short: up with America; up with fashion. If I never get invited back to Europe, or to another conference on structural garment design, I can live with that.<br> <br>Lastly, before I am deluged, inevitably, with mail from academics complaining that I didn&#x2019;t mention a particular neckline or didn&#x2019;t pay proper attention to doublet construction: this isn&#x2019;t meant to be a textbook or exhaustive. Entire books have been written about what in this book are mere paragraphs. I have done my best to make sure the facts are straight, but minutiae have been eliminated. Unless you&#x2019;ve read other histories of fashion, you wouldn&#x2019;t believe the degree of complex detail with which authors write about the transition of a collar width from 1750 to 1753. Do we really care? Well, yes, but not that much.<br> <br>I encourage anyone whose interest in fashion history is sparked by this book to educate themselves further with more-academic sources. For now, I hope you&#x2019;ll enjoy this sweeping and selective look at my favorite parts of fashion history and that it will help drive home how much fun fashion, and historical inquiry, can be.<br> <br>The primary purpose of this book is to give your clothes more significance. I&#x2019;ve found that many people are afraid of taking a hard look at what&#x2019;s in their closets, because fashion is scary to many people. It shouldn&#x2019;t be. Fashion is fun and thrilling&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s something that concerns everyone who gets dressed in the morning, not just an elite crew in Manhattan.<br> <br>I hope this fashion bible will encourage you to study your clothing and appreciate its fascinating origins. Every article means something&#x2014;usually a lot of things. By exploring the meaning and history of our clothes, I hope this book will magically transform your cluttered closet into a world of wonders! To that end, I have included a work sheet at the back of the book as a guide if you&#x2019;d like some suggestions for what to look for and what questions to ask. This kind of closet inventory can teach us a lot about fashion, and a lot about ourselves.<br> <br>So, let&#x2019;s climb into our time machine and get started!</p><h2>Horse Whispers &amp; Lies (Trading Truth for Glory, About Monty Roberts)</h2><p>For fifteen years Monty Roberts has reigned as King among Horse Whisperers.

Faced with the enormity of writing about this huge country, Morris says that ``Canada is one country whose parts are greater than the whole, and its colossal scale is becoming increasingly irrelevant.'' And so she focuses this collection of essays (first commissioned by the editors of the Canadian magazine Saturday Night) on ten urban areas rather than on Canada's immense train lines, tracts of forest, and so on. These areas are: St. John's, St. Andrews, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Banff, Yellowknife, and Vancouver. Morris finds St. John's (Newfoundland) the most entertaining town in North America: ``windy, fishy, anecdotal, proud, weather-beaten, quirky, obliging, ornery, and fun,'' full of irresistible talkers about themselves and their festivals, dramatically fjord-like harbor, and chunky wooden streets whose ``kind of throwaway picturesqueness [suggests] to me sometimes a primitive San Francisco, sometimes Bergen in Norway, occasionally China, and often an Ireland of long ago.'' St. Andrews's nostalgic shoals, islands, fish weirs, and church-bell conservativeness move Morris to thoughts of abandoning her traditional ``radical, if not actually anarchist views....'' Montreal she finds to be the most exciting and volatile Canadian city, with its two hostile linguistic groups. In Ottawa she detects abstraction and allegory, ``some misty iconification of Canada.'' And ``Toronto seems to me, in time as in emotion, a limbo- city....The people in its streets, walking with that steady, tireless, infantry-like pace that is particular to this city, seem on the whole resigned, without either bitterness or exhilaration, to being just what they are.'' Great reading that Canadians as well as folks south will welcome. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In splendid profiles of 10 Canadian cites and towns, travel writer Morris ( Destinations ) demonstrates the rich diversity of the country's mores, values and social and political systems, which, she insists, differ widely from those of the U.S. The French flavor of Quebec and Montreal; Britain's imperial imprint on St. Andrews and Toronto; and the Indian, Metis and Inuit customs of northern reaches recall Canada's origins and colonial beginnings. The daily life of cosmopolitan East and West coast cities is enriched by the cultures of emigrants from Europe and Asia, particularly the Japanese in Banff and Chinese in Vancouver, the author shows. With her unflagging instinct for the telling detail, Morris captures the sensual and atmospheric quality--pleasing or repellent--of a locality and conveys a sense of what it would be like to live there. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Greatest Enemy</h2><p><p>Twenty-five years ago HMS <i>Terrapin</i> was part of a crack hunter/killer group in the Battle of the Atlantic.

Greenberg</strong>was honored in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America with the Ellery Queen Award for lifetime achievement in mystery editing. He is also the recipient of two Anthony awards. <em>Mystery Scene</em> magazine called him "the best mystery anthologist since Ellery Queen." He has compiled more than 1,000 anthologies andis the president of TEKNO books.He lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous sleuthing pair continues to inspire other mystery writers, as witnessed by these three titles. In Millett's novel, Sherlock Holmes, languishing between cases in London, seizes the opportunity to authenticateAfor the Swedish kingAa rune stone found in Minnesota. He and Watson (the narrator, of course) encounter a wide variety of locals, from a wealthy empire builder and a lusty saloon-keeper to a beautiful ex-brothel owner. Before they can examine the stone, however, someone steals it and kills its owner. Secretive, surprising, inventive, and ill-acquainted with modesty, Sherlock and his latest American adventure (e.g., Sherlock Holmes and the Ice Palace Murders) merit wide readership. Mycroft Holmes (Sherlock's older brother) and confidential secretary Peter Guthrie take the place of Holmes and Watson in Fawcett's series (Against the Brotherhood) "authorized" by Dame Jean Conan Doyle. Oddly enough, this pair's mission also involves the Swedish king, whom they must smuggle out of the country aboard a fast train to Scotland. Assassination attempts, murder, conspiracy, and secrecy all lend to the intrigue and tension. Literate prose and an overabundance of detail may dry this out for some, but purchase for fans. More Holmes for the Holidays, a follow-up to the 1996 Holmes for the Holidays, features 11 new tributes to Conan Doyle. Authors include not only well-known mystery writers such as Anne Perry, Jon Breen, and Peter Lovesey but also "cross-over" Western and sf writers, such as Bill Crider, Loren Estleman, and Tanith Lee. In Perry's story, which leads off, Holmes and Watson determine how a priceless Stradivarius was stolen from a locked room during a ten-minute time frame. In Lee's story, the pair confront an apparent puzzle dealing with a beautiful woman and a family curse. All in all, a likely purchase for most short story collections. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Uh-1 Iroquois/Ah-1 Hueycobra (Mo734Ae)</h2><p>1st Ian Allan 1984 print hardcover book.

Immediately he is transported back almost twenty years to his student days in Tokyo, adrift in a world of uneasy friendships, casual sex, passion, loss and desire - to a time when an impetuous young woman called Midori marches into his life and he has to choose between the future and the past.</p><p>In 1987, when <i>Norwegian Wood</i> was first published in Japan, it promptly sold more than 4 million copies and transformed Haruki Murakami into a pop-culture icon. The horrified author fled his native land for Europe and the United States, returning only in 1995, by which time the celebrity spotlight had found some fresher targets. And now he's finally authorized a translation for the English-speaking audience, turning to the estimable Jay Rubin, who did a fine job with his big-canvas production <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>. Readers of Murakami's later work will discover an affecting if atypical novel, and while the author himself has denied the book's autobiographical import--"If I had simply written the literal truth of my own life, the novel would have been no more than fifteen pages long"--it's hard not to read as at least a partial portrait of the artist as a young man. <p> <i>Norwegian Wood</i> is a simple coming-of-age tale, primarily set in 1969-70, when the author was attending university. The political upheavals and student strikes of the period form the novel's backdrop. But the focus here is the young Watanabe's love affairs, and the pain and pleasure and attendant losses of growing up. The collapse of a romance (and this is one among many!) leaves him in a metaphysical shambles: </p><blockquote> I read Naoko's letter again and again, and each time I read it I would be filled with the same unbearable sadness I used to feel whenever Naoko stared into my eyes. I had no way to deal with it, no place I could take it to or hide it away. Like the wind passing over my body, it had neither shape nor weight, nor could I wrap myself in it. </blockquote> This account of a young man's sentimental education sometimes reads like a cross between Sylvia Plath's <i>The Bell Jar</i> and Stephen Vizinczey's <i>In Praise of Older Women</i>. It is less complex and perhaps ultimately less satisfying than Murakami's other, more allegorical work. Still, <i>Norwegian Wood</i> captures the huge expectation of youth--and of this particular time in history--for the future and for the place of love in it. It is also a work saturated with sadness, an emotion that can sometimes cripple a novel but which here merely underscores its youthful poignancy. <i>--Mark Thwaite</i>First American Publication <br>This stunning and elegiac novel by the author of the internationally acclaimed Wind-Up Bird Chronicle has sold over 4 million copies in Japan and is now available to American audiences for the first time. It is sure to be a literary event. <br>Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before. Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there, but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable. As she retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman. <br>A poignant story of one college student's romantic coming-of-age, Norwegian Wood takes us to that distant place of a young man's first, hopeless, and heroic love.</p><h2>Alice Munro: Writing Her Lives: A Biography</h2><p>This is <i>the</i> book about one of the world&#x2019;s great authors, Alice Munro, which shows how her life and her stories intertwine.<br><br>For almost thirty years Robert Thacker has been researching this book, steeping himself in Alice Munro&#x2019;s life and work, working with her co-operation to make it complete. The result is a feast of information for Alice Munro&#x2019;s admirers everywhere.<br><br>By following &#x201c;the parallel tracks&#x201d; of Alice Munro&#x2019;s life and Alice Munro&#x2019;s texts, he gives a thorough and revealing account of both her life and work. &#x201c;There is always a starting point in reality,&#x201d; she once said of her stories, and this book reveals just how often her stories spring from her life.<br><br>The book is chronological, starting with her pioneer ancestors, but with special attention paid to her parents and to her early days growing up poor in Wingham. Then all of her life stages &#x2014; the marriage to Jim Munro, the move to Vancouver, then to Victoria to start the bookstore, the three daughters, the divorce, the return to Huron County, and the new life with Gerry Fremlin &#x2014; leading to the triumphs as, story by story, book by book, she gains fame around the world, until rumours of a Nobel Prize circulate . . .</p><p><b>Robert Thacker</b> wrote his M.A. thesis at Waterloo on Alice Munro way back in 1976. Now the professor of Canadian Studies and English at St. Lawrence University, he was for many years the editor of <i>The American Review of Canadian Studies</i>, and is recognized as the academic authority on Alice Munro.Recalling her university years, Munro says that she loved her time there, &#x201c;being in that atmosphere, having all those books, not having to do any housework. Those are the only two years of my life without housework.&#x201d; Not that she has greatly minded such work, either before university or after, but those two years at Western stand singular in her memory: &#x201c;to have that concentration of your life, that something else was the thing you got up in the morning to do, and it was all reading and writing, studying.&#x201d; Munro enrolled initially in the journalism program as something of a cover, so that she would not have to say that she wrote fiction &#x2014; though, given the contributor note in the April 1950 <i>Folio</i> that has her major as Honours English &#x201c;with an emphasis on creative writing,&#x201d; it was not much of a cover. The journalism program required English, and that first year Munro also took English history (which she says she already knew backwards), economics, French conversation, and psychology. Those enrolled in programs like journalism &#x2014; that is, with some sort of applied focus &#x2014; were put in the same sections of these courses and were seated alphabetically. Thus Alice Laidlaw met Diane Lane &#x2014; a first-ï¿½year pre-business student from Amherstburg &#x2014; who became a friend and roommate.<br><br>Both students had come from small towns, neither had much money (though Laidlaw was the more strapped), and each, initially, roomed with someone she knew from home. During that first year, each found that she was not enjoying the association with her original roommate. So the two took to spending time together at the public library, where Munro had a part-ï¿½time job two or three afternoons a week sorting and reshelving books (as she also did at the Lawson library on campus on Saturday afternoons). Eventually, Munro moved into the same rooming house as Lane &#x2014; the upstairs of a house belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Buck at 1081 Richmond Street &#x2014; where she lived through her second year. Mr. Buck&#x2019;s brother Tim was the leader of the Communist Party of Canada and had been in jail. The Bucks &#x201c;rented the entire upstairs of their house, and it was a place where vaguely intellectual non-ï¿½sorority-ï¿½type girls lived.&#x201d; Munro recalls that &#x201c;we were all fairly poor, and we all cooked these messes we made on hotplates.&#x201d; Socially, at the time, she remembers, &#x201c;Western was fraternity, sorority. Not too serious.&#x201d; That second year was &#x201c;interesting, but fun, because I was then with people at University who were more or less like me.&#x201d; Munro captures some of this in an unpublished draft story called &#x201c;The Art of Fiction,&#x201d; which draws on her time at Western. The narrator writes, &#x201c;During my university years I lived in a house which was not really very big and which sheltered seven other girls, a landlady who wove her own skirts and belonged to a Bell Ringers Society, and a periodically confined lovesick Siamese cat.&#x201d;<br><br>During their first year, both young women took the same English 20 &#x2014; a survey of British literature &#x2014; class from Robert Lawrence and, through him, they came to the attention of the English department. Just as in high school, Munro made her mark by what she wrote: as a student she did not have much to say in class, but Lawrence read &#x201c;The Dimensions of a Shadow,&#x201d; a story she wrote that became her first publication. The English department was seeking students for its honours program, and both Laidlaw and Lane were successfully recruited. Munro recalls that some time during that first year she was approached by Professor Murdo MacKinnon about switching to English. By that time, she remembers, she had &#x201c;run afoul of economics&#x201d; so she asked him if she would have to take more economics. No, he replied, she would need only to pick up the Latin she had missed that first year. So she shifted to English for her second year. That year she took aesthetics from Carl Klinck, eighteenth-ï¿½century British literature from Brandon Conron, a course in drama from Eric Atkinson (&#x201c;the best course I took&#x201d;), French poetry, Greek literature and translation, and another course in English history &#x201c;from a dreadful man&#x201d; who &#x201c;read from notes.&#x201d; Although Munro says she spent about half of her time at Western writing, she did very well in her courses &#x2014; apart from economics. At the end of her second year, she won a prize for the highest marks in English.<br><br>During her first year at Western, Alice Laidlaw was sitting across from another student in the Lawson library. He was eating some candy, a piece of which he accidentally dropped on the floor. This young man had had his eye on Laidlaw and, looking at the candy on the floor as he was wondering what to do, he heard her say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll eat it.&#x201d; Thus Alice Ann Laidlaw met James Armstrong Munro. Jim Munro was from Oakville, the eldest son of Arthur Melville Munro, a senior accountant at the Timothy Eaton company in Toronto, and his wife, Margaret Armstrong Munro. Just under two years older than Alice, Jim was in his second year studying Honours History when he met her. Growing up in Oakville and through high school, he was interested in the arts; he listened to opera and classical music, took art classes, and acted in plays. Jim had seen Alice around the university and had noticed her, but did not know anything about her; he did not know that she was a writer until, when he asked around about her, he was told that Alice Laidlaw &#x201c;was <i>Folio</i>&#x2019;s new find.&#x201d; Recalling himself then, Jim Munro says he was &#x201c;full of poetry and romantic notions&#x201d; &#x2014; he remembers then being under the influence of a book, <i>The Broad Highway</i> by Jeffrey Farnol, about a young man who falls for a high-ï¿½spirited girl. He mirrored the story when he met Alice Laidlaw &#x2014; &#x201c;I really fell hard for her.&#x201d;<br><br>Describing Alice Laidlaw when she was a student at Western, Doug Spettigue, a classmate, recalls that &#x201c;she was shy and small and had a very white face, freckle-ï¿½sprinkled, and chestnut hair. . . . You thought you could stare right through those quiet eyes and the girl would disappear. But she ï¿½didn&#x2019;t. There was an unexpected strength there, and even then a confidence that some of the rest of us, noisier, may have envied.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Voyage of the Beagle: Darwin&#39;s Extraordinary Adventure in Fitzroy&#39;s Famous Survey Ship</h2><p>2009 marks the bi-centennary of the birth of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of his ground-breaking publication &#39;On the Origin of Species&#39; (1859). Many of his scientific investigations and theories have stood the test of time and are still relevant today. There will be many major exhibitions around the world as well as documentaries and debates about Darwin&#34;s work, and a major motion picture is planned on the life of Darwin by the Oscar winning producer Jeremy Thomas. &#39;The Voyage of the Beagle&#39; brings together, for the first time in a single volume, the circumstances that set the Beagle voyage in motion and people who travelled onboard in their various capacities. Chapters include the career history of Beagle, including cabin layouts and plans, biographies on Darwin and Captain Robert Fitzroy and the work of the crewmembers and artists who accompanied the survey voyage. Illustrated with artworks, sketches and charts that were produced during and after the voyage by those on board, as well as portraits and artefacts, and with first-hand accounts in the form of extracts from diaries and letters, James Taylor has woven together all the various strands of the Beagle story to produce a thoroughly engaging and highly informative read that is sure to appeal to anyone from scientists to art lovers and maritime historians.</p><p><b>James Taylor</b> MA (Hons), FRSA, is an expert on maritime art, and lectures regularly to a wide of range of societies, including NADFAS around the world.

His published work includes <i>Marine Painting</i> (1995), <i>Yachts on Canvas </i>(1998), <i>Careless Talk Costs Lives </i>(2010), and catalogs for major exhibitions.<b></b><p>&#x201c;The book brings together a wonderful mixture of old and new illustrations and information about the voyage from widely scattered sources creating a work that will fascinate old Beaglers and landlubbers alike. No Darwin bookshelf would be complete without this book.&#x201d; &#x2015;John Van Wyhe, <i>BBC History Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;James Taylor has adopted a unique way of telling the story in an extremely thorough way, weaving together the various strands of the voyage in a manner not previously adopted, which is much more informative as you see the characters 'in the round.'&#x201d; &#x2015;D. B. Clement, <i>South West Soundings, South West Maritime History Society</i></p><p>&#x201c;It really is a gorgeously produced book, which no Darwin groupie's library should be without. In an earlier review, the Beagle Project's Peter McGrath, FCD, described the book as <i>essential</i> and suggested that some philanthropist should endow every state school biology lab in the country with a copy. I concur wholeheartedly.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Friends of Charles Darwin</i></p></p><h2>Sign-Talker: The Adventure of George Drouillard on the Lewis and Clark Expedition</h2><p>In his extraordinary body of work, James Alexander Thom does more than bring the past to life; he makes us experience history as if we were witnessing it for the first time. Thom's new novel is an enthralling adventure with fascinating real-life characters--and a heart-grabbing narrative that casts a vivid light on a momentous chapter in American history.<br><br>Flint and Steel begins just after the Louisiana Purchase. Thomas Jefferson has sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to penetrate the newly acquired territory, journey up the Missouri River, cross the Rocky Mountains, and reach the glimmering sea in the far West. To survive, the two captains need an extraordinary hunter who will be able to provide the expedition with fresh game, and a sign-talker to communicate with the native tribes. They choose George Drouillard. It is Drouillard, an actual historical figure, who becomes our eyes and ears on this unforgettable odyssey.<br><br>Drouillard, a metis raised among the Shawnee, cannot fathom what drives the two men. Nor can he help but admire their ingenuity and courage as they tackle the journey into the unknown. Along the way, he watches as they shrewdly shape and discipline their force, adding French-Canadian rivermen--to guide the expedition up the Missouri--and an Indian woman, Sacagawea, who will play a crucial role in negotiations with the Western tribes.<br><br>After plunging into an unforgiving land and near madness, the triumphant achievement of two captains will be eclipsed by an overwhelming tragedy that will touch not only Meriwether Lewis and the frontier tribes but George Drouillard himself. A magnificent tale told with intelligence and insight, Flint and Steel is full of song and suffering, humor and pathos. James Alexander Thom has created the rarest reading experience: one that entertains us even as it shows us a new vision of our nation, our past, and ourselves.</p><p><br>"James Alexander Thom . . . make[s] the story of North America come alive.

How are evangelical thinkers responding to this new trend? In Postmodernizing the Faith, respected theologian Millard Erickson explores six evangelical responses--both positive and negative--to postmodernism and offers his own reaction to the movement. Erickson&#39;s purpose is &#34;to introduce readers to postmodernism, to sensitize them to the importance of the issues, and to show them some samples of differing evangelical responses.&#34; Following an introductory chapter describing postmodernism, Erickson presents the responses of three evangelicals who consider the movement incompatible with orthodox Christianity. Next he details the thought of three evangelicals who believe &#34;postmodernism is a development that needs to be accepted, and Christian theology done in light of it, and incorporating at least some of it.&#34; In each chapter Erickson offers a judicious critique, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses of the particular view being discussed.</p><p>Millard J. Erickson is Distinguished Professor of Theology at Baylor University&#39;s Truett Seminary and at Western Seminary, Portland. He is a leading evangelical spokesman with numerous volumes to his credit, including Christian Theology, God in Three Persons, The Word Became Flesh, The Evangelical Left, and Where Is Theology Going?</p><h2>The Hidden Forces Of life</h2><p>The unpredictability of our moods, impulses, and emotions and the apparent randomness of happenings in our external lives are primarily due to the play of hidden forces at work in the world, forces of which we are almost totally unaware.

But everything changes when classmate Wayne Graf&#x2019;s mother dies, which brings to light the secret that Pop is Wayne&#x2019;s father, too. Suddenly, Diggy has a half brother, who moves in and messes up his life. Wayne threatens Diggy&#x2019;s chances at the State Fair, horns in on his girl, and rattles his easy relationship with Pop.<br>What started out great quickly turns into the worst year ever, filled with jealousy, fighting, and several incidents involving cow poop. But as the boys care for their steers, pull pranks, and watch too many B movies, they learn what it means to be brothers and change their concept of family as they slowly steer toward a new kind of normal.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Steering Toward Normal</i></b><br>"First-time author Petruck&#x2019;s account of country life is never dull as she depicts the strong work ethic of cattlemen and women, along with the universal conflicts between siblings."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly<br><br>"</i>The plot is full of pranks and humorous situations but at its heart, it is a story about navigating the complicated and sometimes unexpected dynamics that come with being part of a family. Petruck captures the setting of rural Minnesota well, creating a small town where it seems like nearly everyone is related or at the very least always knows everyone else&#x2019;s business."<br>--<i>VOYA Magazine</i><br><br>"In Petruck&#x2019;s capable hands, raising a steer&#x2014;caring for it, loving it, and eventually letting it go&#x2014;becomes a keen metaphor for the loss of a loved one. Diggy is a perceptive narrator, but not unusually so for his age, and it&#x2019;s reassuring to see him sort out his tangled feelings."<br>--<i>Booklist</i><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rebecca Petruck</b> is a Minnesota girl, though she currently lives in North Carolina, where she earned her MFA in creative writing. A former member of 4-H, she was also a Girl Scout and competed in MATHCOUNTS. She <i>may</i> have pulled a few pranks in her life, though no one can <i>prove</i> she wrapped that entire car in cellophane. This is Rebecca&#x2019;s first novel.Gr 6&#x2013;8&#x2014;A rural small town in Minnesota creates a backdrop for a realistic story focused on relationships and emotions. Diggy Lawson finds out that he has a half brother when his classmate Wayne is dropped off at his house following the death of Wayne's mother and he learns that they share a father. Amidst anger, confusion, grief, competiveness, and even some amusing pranks, Diggy and Wayne both end up raising steers with support from 4-H to enter into the fair. Diggy's anger and confusion seem quite typical for an eighth grader, but his vacillating struggle with these feelings doesn't seem to follow a recognizable path toward growth and reconciliation. The effect is that readers are swept up in Diggy's confusion rather than identifying with it from the role of a sympathetic spectator. Additionally, the plot arc seems flat, as Diggy's emotions seem to reset every couple months. Readers unfamiliar with the routines and sensations of caring for livestock may have difficulty becoming engaged in the overall narrative.While this book fits in a mostly empty niche market for stories about 4-H, it may not be worth purchasing for other communities.&#x2014;Erin Reilly-Sanders, Ohio State University, Columbus</p><h2>Nothing but Winners</h2><p>For New condition books in our store; You will be the first user.

The cantatas of J. S. Bach are among the best known and most frequently performed musical works of the Baroque period. But Bach&#39;s world is no longer our world, so when we hear and perform the cantatas, questions arise that are difficult to answer because we are experiencing the works outside their historical context. Such questions concern the role of the cantatas in Bach&#39;s compositional development, musical models for the works, and performance practice during the composer&#39;s lifetime. In The World of the Bach Cantatas, leading Bach scholars place the works in their historical and biographical context, guiding us through their literary, musical, aesthetic, and theological features. The book covers the sacred cantatas Bach wrote during the first twenty-eight years of his life, before his move to Leipzig in 1723. Designed as an accompaniment to Ton Koopman&#39;s complete set of cantatas now being recorded on the Erato label.</p><p>Christoph Wolff, professor of music and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, ranks as one of the world&#39;s most respected and productive Bach scholars, having published more than fifty articles and several books on the composer. Ton Koopman, internationally acclaimed as a harpsichordist, organist, and conductor, has published books on the theory and practice of Baroque music and on the harpsichord in Dutch art. Contributing authors include Andreas Glckner, Ulrich Leisinger, Daniel R. Melamed, Claus Oefner, Martin Petzoldt, Hans-Joachim Schulze, George B. Stauffer, and Peter Wollny.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Dutch</p><h2>My Lady Innkeeper/An Early Engagement</h2><p>MY LADY INNKEEPER<br>"An attractive, sharp-tongued heroine."<br>--Kirkus Reviews<br>Though Miss Lyndell Markham's ne'er-do-well stepbrother took her money and bought a tawdry inn, Jasper Riddlex was hardly a spy worthy of the gallows!

Jean Hilliker had divorced her fast-buck hustler husband and resurrected her maiden name. Her son, James, was ten years old. He hated and lusted after his mother and &#x201c;summoned her dead.&#x201d; She was murdered three months later.<br><i><br>The Hilliker Curse</i> is a predator&#x2019;s confession, a treatise on guilt and on the power of malediction, and above all, a cri de c&#x153;ur.<i> </i>James<i> </i>Ellroy unsparingly describes his shattered childhood, his delinquent teens, his writing life, his love affairs and marriages, his nervous breakdown, and the beginning of a relationship with an extraordinary woman who may just be the long-sought <i>Her.</i> <br><br>A layered narrative of time and place, emotion and insight, sexuality and spiritual quest, <i>The Hilliker Curse </i>is a brilliant, soul-baring revelation of self. It is unlike any memoir you have ever read.</p><p>James Ellroy was born in Los Angeles in 1948. He is the author of the Underworld U.S.A. Trilogy&#x2014;<i>American Tabloid,</i> <i>The Cold Six Thousand, </i>and <i>Blood&#x2019;s A Rover</i>&#x2014;and the L. A. Quartet novels, <i>The Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, L. A. Confidential,</i> and <i>White Jazz</i>. <i>American Tabloid</i> was <i>Time </i>magazine&#x2019;s Best Book (fiction) of 1995; his memoir <i>My Dark Places</i> was a <i>Time</i> Best Book of the Year and a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book for 1996. <i>The Cold Six Thousand </i>was a <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book and a <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Best Book of 2001. He lives in Los Angeles.1<br><br>The numbers don&#x2019;t matter. It&#x2019;s not a body count, a scratchpad list or a boast. Statistics obscure intent and meaning. My toll is therefore ambiguous. Girlfriends, wives, one-night stands, paid companions. Chaste early figures. A high-stat blitz later on. Quantity means shit in my case. Culminated contact means less than that. I was a watcher at the get-go. Visual access meant capture. The Curse incubated my narrative gift. My voyeur&#x2019;s eye pre-honed it. I lived a kiddie version of my twisted heroes thirty years hence.<br><br><i>We&#x2019;re looking. We&#x2019;re eyeball-arched and orbing in orbit. We&#x2019;re watching women. We want something enormous. My heroes don&#x2019;t know it yet. Their virginal creator has not a clue. We don&#x2019;t know that we&#x2019;re reading personae. We&#x2019;re looking so that we can stop looking. We crave the moral value of one woman. We&#x2019;ll know Her when we see Her. In the meantime, we&#x2019;ll look.</i><br><br>A document denotes my early fixation. It&#x2019;s dated 2/17/55. It predates The Curse by three years. It&#x2019;s a playground shot in Kodak black &amp; white.<br><br>A jungle gym, two slides and a sandbox clutter the foreground. I&#x2019;m standing alone, stage left. I&#x2019;m lurchlike big and unkempt. My upheaval is evident. A stranger would mark me as a fucked-up child in everyday duress. I have beady eyes. They&#x2019;re fixed on four girls, huddled stage right. The photo is rife with objects and children in lighthearted movement. I&#x2019;m coiled in pure study. My scrutiny is staggeringly intense. I&#x2019;ll re-read my mind from 55 years back.<br><br>These four girls bode as The Other. I&#x2019;m a pious Lutheran boy. There can be only one. Is it her, her, her or Her?<br>&nbsp;<br>I think my mother took the picture. A neutral parent would have cropped out the freako little boy. Jean Hilliker at 39: the pale skin and red hair, center- parted and tied back&#x2014;my features and fierce eyes and a sure grace that I have never possessed.<br><br>The photo is a windowsill carving. I was still too young to roam unfettered and press my face up to the glass. My parents split the sheets later that year. Jean Hilliker got primary custody. She put my dad on skates and rolled him to a cheap pad a few blocks away. I snuck out for quick visits. High shrubs and drawn shades blocked my views en route. My mother told me that my father was spying on her. She sensed it. She said she saw smudge marks on her bedroom window. I read the divorce file years later. My father copped out to peeping. He said he peeped to indict my mother&#x2019;s indigenous moral sloth.<br><br>He saw her having sex with a man. It did not legally justify his presence at her window. Windows were beacons. <i>I</i> knew it in my crazed-child rush to The Curse. <i>I</i> entered houses <i>through</i> windows a decade hence. <i>I</i> never left smudge marks. My mother and father taught me that.<br>She had the stones. He had the bunco-artist gab and the grin. She always worked. He dodged work and schemed like Sergeant Bilko and the Kingfish on <i>Amos &#x2019;n&#x2019; Andy</i>. The pastor at my church called him the &#x201c;world&#x2019;s laziest white man.&#x201d; He had a sixteen-inch schlong. It dangled out of his shorts. All his friends talked about it. This is not a whacked-out child&#x2019;s reconstruction.<br><br>Jean Hilliker got bourbon-bombed and blasted the Brahms concertos. Armand Ellroy subscribed to scandal rags and skin magazines. I got two days a week with him. He let me stare out his front window and fuck with his binoculars. My ninth birthday arrived. My mother got me a new church suit. My dad asked me what I wanted. I said I wanted a pair of X-ray eyeglasses. I saw them advertised in a comic book.<br>He yukked and said, Okay. He sent a buck in through the U.S. mail. My wait was grindingly attenuated. I made lists of all the school and church girls that I could see naked. I concocted ways to tape the glasses to my toy periscope. It would provide instant window access.<br><br>I waited&#x2014;March, April, May, &#x2019;57. Late spring through the summer. I couldn&#x2019;t track the sale. I had to trust the manufacturer&#x2019;s honor and efficacy.<br><br>The wait derailed my fantasy life. I spun out in new directions. I sat in my mother&#x2019;s clothes closet. I loved the smell of her lingerie and nurse&#x2019;s uniforms. I swiped my dad&#x2019;s binoculars and spied on a neighbor lady. I saw her reach under her blouse and pluck at her bra strap.<br><br>Fall &#x2019;57. The Long Wait. Mickey Spillane wrote a book with that title. Spillane was the king of the anti-Commie thriller. My dad had a special shelf for his Spillane tomes. He said I could read them on my tenth birthday.<br><br>It&#x2019;s the Season of My Discombobulation. It&#x2019;s winging into the Withering Winter of My Dipshit Discontent. I was agitated. The TV news scared me. The Russians launched <i>Sputnik</i>. Colored kids caused chaos at Central High School. I was dreading Christmas. My mother had scheduled a trip to Madison, Wisconsin. We were going to see her sister. Aunt Leoda married a Catholic. My dad thought she was Red.<br><br>The X- ray eyeglasses arrived.<br><br>My dad forked them over. I unwrapped the package and put them on. I squinted through colored cellophane. I peered around our living room. It was tinted turquoise. <br><br>The walls didn&#x2019;t melt. I couldn&#x2019;t see the crisscrossed beams under the plaster. My dad laughed at me. Sandra Danner&#x2019;s house was three blocks away. I sprinted there, full tilt.<br><br>Sandy and her mom were up stringing Christmas lights. I put my glasses on and stared at them. They laughed at me. Sandy touched her head and twirled a finger. It was &#x2019;50s-speak for <i>He Craaaaazy</i>.<br><br>The glasses were a shuck. I knew about confidence schemes from <i>Whisper</i> magazine. Hucksters sold elderly stiffs plutonium mines in the Alps. They bilked the old cocksuckers and sent them to the poorhouse. I ripped the glasses into shreds of cardboard and cellophane. Sandy Danner went <i>He Craaaaazy</i> again. Her mom offered me a cookie.<br><br>I ran back to the pad. My dad was still laughing. He gave me my consolation prize: a new baseball. I chucked it out the window. My dad yukked and told me to shake a leg. We were going to a movie up in Hollywood. My flight east was that night.<br><br>The flick was called <i>Plunder Road</i>. Psycho losers loot a train loaded with gold bullion. Two of the guys had zaftig blond girlfriends. They wore tight blouses and pedal pushers. The theater was near empty. I moved closer for a better orb on the chicks. My dad lobbed Jordan almonds at my head and chortled.<br><br>The heist went bad. The Main Loser and the Main Blonde welded the bullion to the front bumper of her car and chrome-plated it. They headed out to T.J. on the Hollywood Freeway. Malign fate intervened. The Main Loser and Main Blonde got in a fender bender. An alert cop noticed the gold underplating and wasted the Main Loser&#x2019;s ass. The Main Blonde pitched some boo-hoo. Her big chichis shook.<br><br>The movie spooked me. My wig was loose. I didn&#x2019;t want to fly to Dogdick, Wisconsin. My dad strolled me down Hollywood side streets and cut north on Cherokee. He installed me on the front steps of a building. He said he&#x2019;d be inside for an hour. He gave me a comic book and said, Don&#x2019;t roam.<br><br>I was a dirty-minded child with a religious streak. My shit detector clicked in, resultantly. My mom told a friend that my dad craved skirt action. I heard my dad use the term <i>fuck pad</i>. I concluded this: He&#x2019;s porking the Main Blonde from the movie.<br><br>I noticed a half-full jug of cheap wine by the mailbox bank. I guzzled it and got goofy and euphoric. I&#x2019;m tanked. I go window-peeping.<br><br>Cherokee north of the Boulevard. Spanish apartment houses and bungalow courts. Windows ringed with Christmas lights. Low first-floor windowsills. Perch spots for a tall little boy hot to LOOK.<br><br>I was blitzed. It was 53 years ago. I know I didn&#x2019;t see the Main Blonde or my dad in the saddle. I know I saw a fat guy flipping burgers. I know I saw a skinny lady watching TV.<br><br>It all blurred then. Booze blackout&#x2014;age nine.<br><br>I recall a queasy cab ride. I&#x2019;m back at my mom&#x2019;s pad in Santa Monica. I&#x2019;m in my church suit. We&#x2019;re on an airplane. Jean Hilliker&#x2019;s wearing a blue serge dress and holding an overcoat. Her red hair is cinched by a tortoiseshell barrette. She&#x2019;s drinking a highball and smoking a cigarette.<br><br>I leaned close. She misunderstood my intent and ruffled my hair. I wanted to nuzzle her and taste the bourbon. She didn&#x2019;t know that.<br><br>I dozed off. Jean Hilliker dozed off. I woke up and watched her sleep. She was 42 now. She was boozing more. It showed on her face. She went back to Hilliker, post-divorce decree. It stigmatized me. Her pride, my bifurcated identity. I killed off the dregs of her highball and ate the cherry. It gave me a residual jolt. I saw a woman enter a lavatory at the rear of the plane.<br><br>I traipsed over and perched near the door. Passing adults ignored me. Women used the facility. I hovered and heard the door locks click. The women exited and scowled at me. I read biblical censure on their faces. One woman forgot to lock the door. I barged in accidentally on purpose. The woman shrieked. I saw sheer nylon stockings and some skin.<br>Madison, Wisconsin, was lake-bound and penguin-shit cold. A snow-covered field flanked Aunt Leoda&#x2019;s house. I got into a snowball fight the first day. An ice-crusted ball busted up my face and loosened some wobbly teeth. I holedup in a back bedroom and brooded.<br><br>My cousins were off being happy kids at Christmas. Jean Hilliker was off with plain-Jane Aunt Leoda and porky Uncle Ed. Uncle Ed sold Buicks. My mother purchased a red-and-white sedan from him. The plan: drive the fucker back to L.A. after New Year&#x2019;s.<br><br>I brooded. The practice entailed long stints alone in the dark. I thought about girls then. I brain-screened girls I&#x2019;d seen at school and at church. It was a pure visual panoply. I did not impose story lines. I have formally brooded through to this moment. I lie in the dark, shut my eyes and <i>think.</i> I think about women primarily. I quite often tremble and sob. My heart swells in sync with women&#x2019;s faces merged with improvised stories. History intercedes. Great public events run counterpoint to deep human love. Women glimpsed for half seconds carry a spiritual weight equal to my long-term lovers.<br><br>Bumfuck, Wisconsin, was a drag. My mouth hurt. The fucking snowball sliced my lips. I couldn&#x2019;t kiss Christine Nelson from school. My dad said he knew a TV babe named Chris Nelson. She was married to a Hebe named Louie Quinn. Chris was a nympho. She flashed her snatch at him at some movie-biz party.<br><br>The adults came home. My mother brought me a library book. It was wholesome kids&#x2019; fare, full of mystical shit. It pertained to witchcraft, spells and curses. My mother turned the bedroom lights on. I had to read rather than brood.<br><br>The book jazzed me. I tore through it quicksville. It felt like it was written<i> for</i> me. The mystical jive derived from my ancestral home of Shitsville, Great Britain. Magic potions abounded. Warlocks guzzled secret brews and had visions. This wowed the incipient boozehound and dope fiend in me. The overall text buttressed religious lore I believed in then and believe in today.<br><i><br>There&#x2019;s a world we can&#x2019;t see. It exists separately and concurrently with the real world. You enter this world by the offering of prayer and incantation. You live in this world wholly within your mind. You dispel the real world through mental discipline. You rebuff the real world through your enforced mental will. Your interior world will give you what you want and what you need to survive.</i><br><br>I believed it then. I believe it now. My many years in the dark have confirmed it as a primary article of faith. I was nine then. I&#x2019;m 62 now. The real world has frequently intruded on my spells in the dark. That book formally sanctioned me to lie still and conjure women. I did it then. I do it still. That book described the destructive power of formal invective. The notion of The Curse did not feel prophetic in late 1957. It was simply a footnote to my license to fantasize.<br><br>I have a superbly honed memory. My time in the dark has enhanced my process of minutely detailed recollection. My mental ruthlessness asserted itself early on.<br><br>I needed a Curse a few months later. I was insolently well prepared.<br><br>The new Buick was a full-dress road hog. It had wide whites and more chrome than the <i>Plunder Road</i> death sled. I wanted to zoom it back to L.A. and see my dad. I wanted to resume my fantasy life back on my home turf.<br><br>The adults went nightclubbing on New Year&#x2019;s Eve. A German immigrant girl baby-sat my cousins and me. She was 17 or 18, acne-addled and plump. She wore a reindeer blouse and a flannel skirt with a pink embroidered poodle. She emitted Hitler-Jugend vibes.<br><br>She tucked me in last. The bedroom door was shut. Her fluttery presence felt un-kosher. She sat on the edge of the bed and patted me. The vibe devolved. She pulled down the covers and sucked my dick.<br><br>I dug it and recoiled from it in equal measure. I withstood thirty seconds and pushed her off. She talked a Kraut blue streak and bolted the room. I killed the lights and brooded out the bad juju.<br><br>I felt sideswiped, more than assaulted. I recalled the magic-spell book. I figured I could brew a blank-memory elixir. I could create X-ray eye powder at the same time. I got bilked on those glasses. My secret eyeball blend would set that straight.</p><h2>The Beautiful Fall: Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent, and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris</h2><p>Drake presents a sublime and dramatic narrative about the high-chic fashion wars of 1970s Paris where two titanic geniuses and rivals, Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagefeld, collided and sparked a tumultuous decade.</p><p>Alicia Drake writes regularly for publications including International Herald Tribune, British Vogue, Travel and Leisure, and magazine, for which she was a contributing editor. She has lived and worked in Paris for the last 10 years.*Starred Review* The relationship between hedonism and decay and the understanding of excess as creative consumption are themes central to this glittering exegesis. Drake conducted more than 100 interviews in her scrupulous chronicle of fashion's most illustrious rivalry. Yves Saint Laurent, the charmed genius of effortless success, and Karl Lagerfeld, the patrician workhorse, engaged in a decades-long competition for hyperbolic headlines and jet-set celebrity, pitting their cliques against each other in bitch-slap feuds of sartorial splendor. Theirs is a world of glorious, hideous self-involvement, where heroin is an accessory, violent political unrest is an evening's amusement, and a close friend's suicide is, foremost, a contemptible blemish on an orchestrated image. Drake's subjects made their livings and their names dedicating themselves to the pursuit of surface perfection, and her comprehensive examination of their barbed, parallel arcs is appropriately superficial. These titanic designers crafted their personas as carefully as they put together their luxurious collections, and we come to know them as reflections in the mirror houses they built. Although their individual aesthetics and personal recriminations are unique, they are united in the opulent glory of their narcissistic myopia. Ultimately, Drake makes a good case for the extraordinary nature of their individual achievements and the revolutionary effect of their competitive energy on the fashion industry. And yet we're left with a portrait defined more by the careful craft of its brushstrokes than by the substance of the sitters. <i>Thomas Barthelmess</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

A look of pain and sorrow crossed her face, but when he couldn&#x2019;t look her in the eyes, she took a deep breath and let it out with the shake of her head. Her mouth was set in a firm, hard line as she navigated through the other patrons to their table.<br> <br>When she arrived, the older of the two men stuck out his hand, but she ignored it and turned toward his younger companion. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say I approve of the company you keep these days, Micah, but it is nice to see you,&#x201d; she said as she sat down.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you, too, Rose,&#x201d; Micah Gallo replied quietly.<br> <br>A waitress strolled over and Rose Lubinsky asked for a glass of water. Shrugging, the older man tapped the rim of his highball glass to indicate that he wanted another Old Forester bourbon. Pricey stuff, but the president of the largest teachers union in New York State, with his quarter-of-a-million-dollar salary and under-the-table perks, could afford it.<br> <br>Despite his expensive tastes in clothes, cars, women, and bourbon, Thomas &#x201c;Tommy&#x201d; Monroe came from the old Irish-Italian neighborhood of Bensonhurst, the son of a schoolteacher mom and a truck-driving father. A big guy, he&#x2019;d played football for a second-tier college team until he got kicked off the squad for fighting with his teammates and coaches, and then walking out on an &#x201c;anger management&#x201d; class he&#x2019;d been ordered to attend if he wanted to stay. Following an &#x201c;incident&#x201d; in which he&#x2019;d been accused of raping a coed at a fraternity party, he&#x2019;d then been invited to leave the college altogether and had to finish his degree and get his teacher&#x2019;s certificate at a small liberal arts college in New Jersey that didn&#x2019;t care about his character as long as he paid his tuition.<br> <br>After graduation, he took a job as a PE teacher and wrestling coach at Public School 238 in Brooklyn but found his true calling working for the Greater New York Teachers Federation. Like all other public school teachers, he&#x2019;d had to sign up with the union when he first got hired&#x2014;there was no choice in the matter and dues were automatically taken out of his paycheck. But as the son of a teamster and a proud member of the teachers union, he&#x2019;d been fine with it and soon found out that his penchant for cracking heads and kicking asses on behalf of the GNYTF was useful to the hierarchy. He could turn on the macho charm when necessary, but it was his ruthlessness and street smarts that helped him climb the union power ladder and eventually got him elected president.<br> <br>That had been twenty years ago and now in his early sixties, the former athlete had gone to seed. His ruddy Irish face and red nose belied his affection for booze and the good life, as did the beer belly that hung over the top of his expensive, tailored pants. And he&#x2019;d long since lost his sense of duty to union members, except as pawns to manipulate in order to stay in power and fund his lifestyle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever works&#x201d; was his motto when dealing with opponents, both those inside the union&#x2014;including reform-minded individuals&#x2014;and those on the outside. One of the most tenacious of the latter, and the reason for this meeting with Rose Lubinsky, were the proponents of charter schools. The charter school movement in New York got its start in 1998, and after being held in check&#x2014;mainly due to union lobbying&#x2014;for ten years, had been expanding ever since thanks in large part to Lubinsky, the president of the New York Charter Schools Association and the heart and soul of the movement. Limited to a hundred schools in that first decade, there were four times that number now and a serious threat to the union and thus to Monroe.<br> <br>The reasons were simple. First of all, the charter schools, although public and taxpayer-funded, were nonunion. This diluted the power of the traditional large teachers unions like the GNYTF to control education in New York State. And every one of those nonunion teachers represented a loss in union dues. Fewer bucks meant losing political clout by curtailing lobbying, or outright buying of, politicians and the leaders of the union-funded, anti-charter parent groups. It also meant less money for the union president&#x2019;s salary and bonuses, as well as the hidden slush fund available for his &#x201c;expenses.&#x201d;<br> <br>For the first time in years, Monroe felt his position as union president was being threatened by increasingly unhappy members. Every student sitting in a charter schoolroom instead of the union-dominated public school rolls meant less money from the state and federal governments which based their financial support on enrollment. Losing funding affected raises and bonuses for union teachers, too. However, the members&#x2019; dissatisfaction was as much about working conditions as it was money. Public school classes were overcrowded, filled with indifferent and even hostile students, and lacked any support from most of the parents.<br> <br>Charter schools were a different story with a combination of better or equal pay, safer working conditions, students who wanted to learn, and administrations that by and large saw themselves as partners with their faculty. The best teachers, as well as the more dedicated students, were leaving the public schools as fast as they could find an opening with a charter school. Only the limited number of positions available kept the desertions from becoming an all-out stampede.<br> <br>Meanwhile, union members were openly questioning if Monroe was losing his grip. Meetings were becoming increasingly contentious, and his spies reported teachers grumbling about his ostentatious lifestyle; his reform-minded union opponents were gaining ground.<br> <br>Since the beginning, Monroe had fought the charter school movement tooth and nail. Fear had been a major tactic, telling teachers that charter schools were a threat to the union, and without the union to protect them, all the benefits like pensions, health coverage, and wages they&#x2019;d won over the years would be lost. Using a public relations firm, and aided by a compliant media, he mislabeled charter schools &#x201c;elitist,&#x201d; especially in black and Hispanic neighborhoods, claiming that they were a conservative white man&#x2019;s conspiracy to remove the best and brightest from the &#x201c; &#x2019;hood&#x201d; and leave everyone else to suffer. It didn&#x2019;t matter to his public relations spiel that charter school enrollment was predominantly from minority neighborhoods. &#x201c;Divide and conquer&#x201d; was the purpose behind &#x201c;racist&#x201d; charter schools, he claimed, and that played well with his core constituency.<br> <br>If words and fear didn&#x2019;t work, he fell back on payoffs and intimidation, including physical attacks and character assassination. A few years earlier, he&#x2019;d employed such against one particularly difficult opponent, the man now sitting next to him, Micah Gallo, at the time a young, energetic Hispanic who had started the first charter school in Brooklyn for low-income, disadvantaged children.<br> <br>Gallo had grown up in that neighborhood, had even been the leader of a gang. But he survived the public schools and after graduating from a teachers college had quickly signed on with Lubinsky and the charter school association, which helped him launch the Bedford-Stuyvesant Charter School. The school had been a resounding success. Although its teachers were initially paid less than union teachers in the public schools, their working conditions were far superior, even though they&#x2019;d had to share space with a public school, and soon the students&#x2019; test scores outstripped their public school counterparts by large margins.<br> <br>Monroe felt the tide turning against him and the union when The New York Times published a big feature story on Gallo and his school, comparing it favorably to the public schools in the five boroughs. When the story came out, and then was picked up by local television stations, Monroe took a lot of heat from union teachers and parents. It had made them look bad, they said, and they wanted to know why he&#x2019;d been unable to counter. This time they weren&#x2019;t so accepting of his promises to quash the charter school movement, and his attempts to get his pals in the media to back him met with shrugs and noncommittal responses.<br> <br>Monroe decided that it was time to eliminate the competition and started by trying to buy Gallo. He offered him the position of assistant superintendent of the Greater New York school system at a salary many times what he made at the charter school with broad hints of there being more where that came from. The young man turned him down and threatened to go to the press if he tried to bribe him again.<br> <br>So he reverted to his more base nature. He arranged for die-hard union supporters to try to intimidate Gallo by lurking outside the school and following him home. They punctured his tires and scratched the paint on his car. When that didn&#x2019;t work, a &#x201c;specialist&#x201d; was called in; in the dead of night, Gallo&#x2019;s car was firebombed.<br> <br>Instead of chasing Gallo off, however, the bombing backfired. Charter school parents started escorting him to and from work and watched his neighborhood. An even more in-depth article appeared in a weekly alternative newspaper, The West Village Spectator, written by investigative journalist Ariadne Stupenagel. The article and citizen complaints put the pressure on the police to step up patrols and get serious about trying to catch his antagonists. Even Monroe&#x2019;s ties to the police union reps did him no good; in fact, he was warned that if something bad happened to Gallo all bets were off.<br> <br>Gallo weathered the storm, though not without damage. Monroe&#x2019;s spies reported that he didn&#x2019;t appear to be sleeping well and dark circles had appeared below his eyes. &#x201c;He seems tense, like another good shove and he might break,&#x201d; one said. But he refused to give in, and Monroe looked for the proverbial last straw. Alas, Olivia Stone, his longtime partner in crime, provided it.<br> <br>Stone, the former attorney for the teachers union, had high aspirations. With the financial and &#x201c;get the vote out&#x201d; backing of the union, Stone had campaigned for and been elected district attorney of Kings County, which encompassed all of the two million&#x2013;plus residents of Brooklyn. She was unqualified for the job, having spent a few years in the Legal Aid Society Office before following the money to the teachers union. However, the incumbent district attorney&#x2019;s campaign had been torpedoed by scandal&#x2014;an alleged affair with a stripper from the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn&#x2014;two weeks before the election. Of course, Monroe&#x2019;s political operatives created and disseminated the faux rumored affair. By the time the incumbent had dispelled the false allegations, the smear tactic had worked; he was out of office and Stone was in.<br> <br>It was real handy to have the DA of Kings County to help deal with problems, such as Micah Gallo. They&#x2019;d concocted a plan to finish the job that Monroe had started. When one of Monroe&#x2019;s spies told him that Gallo sometimes took his school laptop computer home with him, they knew they had what they needed.<br> <br>Gallo&#x2019;s school was actually located in a portion of one of Brooklyn&#x2019;s shuttered public high schools. As charter schools were still tax-supported and the equipment inside the schools was owned by the public, technically, taking the laptop to his residence&#x2014;even if for work purposes&#x2014;was illegally removing school property.<br> <br>A cooperative police detective took an anonymous complaint from a &#x201c;concerned source&#x201d; that school equipment had been disappearing and that Gallo was suspected of selling it off and lining his own pockets with the proceeds. Stone secured a search warrant from a union-supported judge and the police raided Gallo&#x2019;s home where not only was the &#x201c;stolen school property&#x201d; laptop located but also several other pieces of equipment.<br> <br>Of course, it was all a big setup. Teachers and administrators routinely took work-related material and equipment home. The additional &#x201c;public school equipment&#x201d; was planted. Gallo was arrested.<br> <br>This time Monroe&#x2019;s lackeys in the press were only too happy to jump all over the story. The former gangbanger-turned-heroic-educator&#x2019;s fall from grace was just too good a scandal. A little bird had even tipped off a photographer for the New York Post so that there was a perp photo on page three of Gallo being led from his home in handcuffs.<br> <br>Monroe at first declined to comment on &#x201c;the unfortunate situation.&#x201d; But when pressed for a quote, he &#x201c;reluctantly&#x201d; acknowledged that &#x201c;the lack of oversight and supervision&#x201d; at charter schools was one of the &#x201c;major drawbacks. They sort of operate under their own rules even with taxpayer money.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gallo still had his supporters in the media, including Stupenagel, who wrote a scathing piece about the &#x201c;politically motivated attack on charter schools by drumming up a ridiculous charge against one of the charter schools movement&#x2019;s bright young stars.&#x201d; The reporter noted the connection between Monroe and Stone and accused the two of &#x201c;colluding in order to preserve the union&#x2019;s power and influence.&#x201d;<br> <br>Monroe denied any involvement in Gallo&#x2019;s troubles. However, Stone shot back at the critics in media interviews by noting &#x201c;we don&#x2019;t make the laws; we are charged with enforcing them and prosecuting those who break them. We believe, and the grand jury agreed, that there is sufficient evidence indicating that Mr. Gallo broke the law, stole equipment owned by the taxpayers, and needs to answer for that. However, we will try this case in court, not the media.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gallo had his other supporters, too, chief among them Rose Lubinsky. She had taken the fight to the media, some of which questioned the motives behind Stone&#x2019;s prosecution of Gallo. The district attorney took a lot of heat, but she didn&#x2019;t cave. She knew the power and money she craved relied on the support from the teachers union. Stone and Monroe were determined to create a chilling effect on other charter supporters by prosecuting and breaking Gallo.<br> <br>Besides, Monroe thought, if Stone backed off, Gallo would have become the darling of the media and Stone would have taken a major political hit. By sticking to her &#x201c;we don&#x2019;t make the laws&#x201d; mantra and going forward with the charges against Gallo she could attack the charter school system and argue that she had no choice but to follow up on the case presented to her by the police.<br> <br>Unfortunately for Gallo, neither he nor the charter system was insured for this sort of legal battle. Determined to save his freedom and reputation against the false charges, he spent his life savings and mortgaged his home. The school was forced to close.<br> <br>Told that Gallo was desperate, Monroe arranged a meeting. He told the young man that not only could he make the charges go away, but &#x201c;I like your spunk, kid&#x201d; and that he would hire him as his personal aide. It was a lifeline thrown by the devil, but Gallo grabbed it.<br> <br>In the few years since, Gallo had sealed the deal by becoming the union&#x2019;s chief anti-charter school advocate. Of course, he knew where the warts were in the charter system and how best to attack the public&#x2019;s perception of its schools. He&#x2019;d become such a vocal opponent of &#x201c;elitist, racist&#x201d; charter schools that Monroe sometimes wondered if the young man truly believed what he was saying.<br> <br>Broken psychologically...</p><h2>Watercolor and How</h2><p>Introduces the brushes, paints, tools, techniques, and papers used in watercolor painting, and includes advice on composition, texture, and style</p><p></p><h2>Anastasia: The Last Grand Duchess, Russia, 1914</h2><p>Award-winning author Carolyn Meyer's ANASTASIA is back in print with a gorgeous new package!<br><br>Thirteen-year-old Anastasia is the youngest daughter of Czar Nicholas II, ruler of Russia.

While her father attends to the turbulent affairs of a vast and complex country, Anastasia's major concerns are how to get out of her detested schoolwork to play in the snow, go ice skating, or have picnics. She wears diamonds and rubies, and every morning her mother tells her which matching outfit she and her three sisters shall wear that day. Slowly a hint of future trouble enters her happy, pampered life. Anastasia's younger brother, the future tsar, is a hemophiliac--a "bleeder" who cannot stop bleeding if he is cut or bruised. Anastasia begins to learn that all is not well in the outside world, either. Not everyone in Russia worships her father as she does, and the Germans are about to declare war on Russia. Anastasia's world gradually deteriorates, as reported in her youthful, often playful journal.<p> As Russia entered World War I, hunger and poverty grew among the peasants, and the Romanov ruling family began to lose favor, culminating in their murders--including Anastasia's--by Bolshevik revolutionaries. This fictionalized diary of the mischievous youngest daughter's last four years gives a fascinating glimpse into a life of unlimited wealth--and the subsequent downward spiral. Historical notes, family trees, and photographs round out Carolyn Meyer's compelling contribution to the popular Royal Diaries series.

He is internationally known for his popular books on archaeology. He lives in Santa Barbara, California.Fagan has written numerous archaeology books (e.g., <i>The Little Ice Age,</i> 2000), but his inaugural title from 1975 was out of print. This welcome revision recounts the encounter of all manner of people, from Herodotus to Howard Carter of Tutankhamen fame, with the pharaonic ruins of the Nile Valley. Modern interest in the imposing antiquity and scale of Giza, the Valley of the Kings, and the like dates from the French invasion of 1798, which included a scientific team--"the Enlightenment in action," in Fagan's words--to survey pyramids, temples, and tombs; its work provoked a rage in Europe for all things Egyptian. Some tackled the problem of unlocking hieroglyphics (achieved by Jean-Francois Champollion); others flexed their muscles to get the good stuff out of Egypt, like Giovanni Belzoni. By far the star attraction in Fagan's presentation, Belzoni was an ebulliently colorful character--a circus strongman in 1810 who chanced into the ancient Egypt craze and its accompanying lust for artifacts. That's how Egyptology began, and Fagan's history is a fine gateway to it. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Both of his parents spoke Spanish and English fluently, and "Georgie," as Borges was affectionately called, grew up trilingual, spending much of his childhood exploring his father's extensive library filled with books written in English, Spanish, and French.<br><br>In 1914 the Borges family moved to Europe-first to Switzerland, where young Borges and his sister Norah attended the College Calvin in Geneva, then to various cities in Spain. In Madrid, Borges began to acquaint himself with burgeoning avant-garde movements such as ultraism, and published poems in local literary magazines. In 1921 the family returned to Argentina, where Borges founded two literary magazines and published his first poetry collections, Fervor de Buenos Aires (1923) and Luna de Enfrente (1925). The poems deal mainly with Borges's exuberant revisit to his hometown and his keen observations of the local color and gaucho tradition that dwelt within. In the early thirties, Borges began publishing collections of essays before he forayed into the genre for which he is perhaps best known and most praised-the short story. His first short story collections, Historia universal de la infamia [A Universal History of Infamy] (1935) and Ficciones (1944), earned him recognition as one of Argentina's greatest writers. Borges won the 1961 Prix Formentor, the International Publisher's Prize, for Ficciones.<br><br>From 1938 until his retirement in 1973, Borges held several jobs. The first was in a local library, a position that he described as nine years of "solid unhappiness." Not usually known for his political views, Borges began to speak out against then dictator Juan Perï¿½n; Perï¿½n retaliated by appointing Borges National Poultry Inspector. After Perï¿½n's fall, Borges was named director of the National Library of Argentina by the new government and served as professor of German, English, and North American literatures at the University of Buenos Aires. In the meantime, he wrote such notable works as Labyrinths (1962), Elogie de la sombra [In Praise of Darkness] (1969), and El informe de Brodie [Doctor Brodie's Report] (1970)-all collections of essays, poetry, and short stories.<br><br>During the late seventies and early eighties, at which point Borges was nearly blind, he continued to publish essays and short story collections. In April of 1986, he married his longtime secretary and collaborator Marï¿½a Kodama, and died later that same year of liver cancer.<br><br>This interview was conducted in July 1966, in conversations I held with Borges at his office in the Biblioteca Nacional, of which he is the director. The room, recalling an older Buenos Aires, is not really an office at all, but a large, ornate, high-ceilinged chamber in the newly renovated library. On the walls-but far too high to be easily read, as if hung with diffidence-are various academic certificates and literary citations. There are also several Piranesi etchings, bringing to mind the nightmarish Piranesi ruin in Borges's story "The Immortal." Over the fireplace is a large portrait; when I asked Borges's secretary, Miss Susana Quinteros, about the portrait, she responded in a fitting, if unintentional, echo of a basic Borgesian theme: "No importa. It's a reproduction of another painting."<br><br>At diagonally opposite corners of the room are two large, revolving bookcases which contain, Miss Quinteros explained, books Borges frequently consults, all arranged in a certain order and never varied so that Borges, who is nearly blind, can find them by position and size. The dictionaries, for instance, are set together, among them an old, sturdily rebacked, well-worn Anglo-Saxon dictionary. Among the other volumes, ranging from books in German and English on theology and philosophy to literature and history, are the complete Pelican Guide to English Literature, the Modern Library Francis Bacon, Hollander's The Poetic Eddas, The Poems of Catullus, Forsyth's Geometry of Four Dimensions, several volumes of Harrap's English Classics, Parkman's The Conspiracy of Pontiac, and the Chambers edition of Beowulf. Recently, Miss Quinteros said, Borges had been reading The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War, and just the night before he had taken to his home, where his mother (who is in her nineties) reads aloud to him, Washington Irving's Life of Mahomet. Each day, late in the afternoon, Borges arrives at the library, where it is now his custom to dictate letters and poems which Miss Quinteros types and reads back to him. Following his revisions, she makes two or three, sometimes four copies of each poem before Borges is satisfied. Some afternoons she reads to him, and he carefully corrects her English pronunciation. Occasionally when he wants to think, Borges leaves his office and slowly circles the library's rotunda, high above the readers at the tables below. But he is not always serious, Miss Quinteros stressed, confirming what one might expect from his writing: "Always there are jokes, little practical jokes."<br><br>When Borges entered the library, wearing a beret and a dark grey flannel suit hanging loosely from his shoulders and sagging over his shoes, everyone stopped talking for a moment, pausing, perhaps out of respect, perhaps out of empathetic hesitation for a man who is not entirely blind. His walk is tentative, and he carries a cane which he uses like a divining rod. He is short, with hair that looks slightly unreal in the way it rises from his head. His features are vague, softened by age, partially erased by the paleness of his skin. His voice, too, is unempathetic, almost a drone, seeming, possibly because of the unfocused expression of his eyes, to come from another person behind the face, and his gestures and expressions are lethargic-characteristic is the involuntary droop of one eyelid. But when he laughs-and he laughs often-his features wrinkle into what actually resembles a wry question mark; and he is apt to make a sweeping or clearing gesture with his arm and to bring his hand down on the table. Most of his statements take the form of rhetorical questions; but in asking a genuine question, Borges displays now a looming curiosity, now a shy, almost pathetic incredulity. When he chooses, as in telling a joke, he adopts a crisp, dramatic tone, and his quotation of a line from Oscar Wilde would do justice to an Edwardian actor. His accent defies easy classification: a cosmopolitan diction emerging from a Spanish background, educated by correct English speech and influenced by American movies. (Certainly no Englishman ever pronounced piano as pie-ano, and no American says a-nee-hilates for annihilates.) The predominant quality of his articulation is the way his words slur softly into one another, allowing suffixes to dwindle so that couldn't and could are virtually indistinguishable. Slangy and informal when he wants to be, more typically he is formal and bookish in his English speech, relying, quite naturally, on phrases like "that is to say" and "wherein." Always his sentences are linked by the narrative "and then" or the logical "consequently."<br><br>But most of all, Borges is shy. Retiring, even self-obliterating, he avoids personal statement as much as possible and obliquely answers questions about himself by talking of other writers, using their words and even their books as emblems of his own thought.<br><br>In this interview, it has been attempted to preserve the colloquial quality of his English speech-an illuminating contrast to his writings and a revelation of his intimacy with a language that has figured so importantly in the development of his writing.<br><br>interviewer: You don't object to my recording our conversations?<br><br>jorge luis borges: No, no. You fix the gadgets. They are a hindrance, but I will try to talk as if they're not there. Now where are you from?<br><br>interviewer: From New York.<br><br>borges: Ah, New York. I was there and I liked it very much-I said to myself: "Well, I have made this; this is my work."<br><br>interviewer: You mean the walls of the high buildings, the maze of streets?<br><br>borges: Yes. I rambled about the streets-Fifth Avenue-and got lost, but the people were always kind. I remember answering many questions about my work from tall, shy young men. In Texas they had told me to be afraid of New York, but I liked it. Well, are you ready?<br><br>interviewer: Yes, the machine is already working.<br><br>borges: Now, before we start, what kind of questions are they?<br><br>interviewer: Mostly about your own work and about English writers you have expressed an interest in.<br><br>borges: Ah, that's right. Because if you ask me questions about the younger contemporary writers, I'm afraid I know very little about them. For about the last seven years I've been doing my best to know something of Old English and Old Norse. Consequently, that's a long way off in time and space from the Argentine, from Argentine writers, no? But if I have to speak to you about the Finnsburg Fragment or the elegies or the Battle of Brunanburg . . .<br><br>interviewer: Would you like to talk about those?<br><br>borges: No, not especially.<br><br>interviewer: What made you decide to study Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse?<br><br>borges: I began by being very interested in metaphor. And then in some book or other-I think in Andrew Lang's History of English Literature-I read about the kennings, metaphors of Old English, and in a far more complex fashion of Old Norse poetry. Then I went in for the study of Old English. Nowadays, or rather today, after several years of study, I'm no longer interested in the metaphors, because I think that they were rather a weariness of the flesh to the poets themselves-at least to the Old English poets.<br><br>interviewer: To repeat them you mean?<br><br>borges: To repeat them, to use them over and over again and to keep on speaking of the hronrad, waelrad, or "road of the whale" instead of "the sea"-that kind of thing-and "the sea-wood," "the stallion of the sea" instead of "the ship." So I decided finally to stop using them, the metaphors that is; but in the meanwhile I had begun studying the language and I fell in love with it. Now I have formed a group-we're about six or seven students-and we study almost every day. We've been going through the highlights in Beowulf, the Finnsburg Fragment and The Dream of the Rood. Also, we've gotten into King Alfred's prose. Now we've begun learning Old Norse, which is rather akin to Old English. I mean the vocabularies are not really very different: Old English is a kind of halfway house between the Low German and the Scandinavian.<br><br>interviewer: Epic literature has always interested you very much, hasn't it?<br><br>borges: Always, yes. For example, there are many people who go to the cinema and cry. That has always happened: it has happened to me also. But I have never cried over sob stuff, or the pathetic episodes. But, for example, when I saw the first gangster films of Sternberg I remember that when there was anything epic about them-I mean Chicago gangsters dying bravely-well, I felt that my eyes were full of tears. I have felt epic poetry far more than lyric or elegy. I always felt that. Now that may be, perhaps, because I come from military stock. My grandfather, Colonel Borges, fought in the border warfare with the Indians and he died in a revolution; my great-grandfather, Colonel Suï¿½rez, led a Peruvian cavalry charge in one of the last great battles against the Spaniards; another great-uncle of mine led the vanguard of San Martï¿½n's army-that kind of thing. And I had, well, one of my great-great-grandmothers was a sister of Rosas-I'm not especially proud of that relationship, because I think of Rosas as being a kind of Perï¿½n in his day; but still all those things link me with Argentine history and also with the idea of a man's having to be brave, no?<br><br>interviewer: But the characters you pick as your epic heroes-the gangster for example-are not usually thought of as epic, are they? Yet you seem to find the epic there?<br><br>borges: I think there is a kind of, perhaps, low epic in him-no?<br><br>interviewer: Do you mean that since the old kind of epic is apparently no longer possible for us, we must look to this kind of character for our heroes?<br><br>borges: I think that as to epic poetry or as to epic literature, rather-if we except such writers as T. E. Lawrence in his Seven Pillars of Wisdom or some poets like Kipling, for example in "Harp Song of the Dane Women" or even in the stories-I think nowadays, while literary men seem to have neglected their epic duties, the epic has been saved for us, strangely enough, by the Westerns.<br><br>interviewer: I have heard that you have seen the film West Side Story many times.<br><br>borges: Many times, yes. Of course, West Side Story is not a Western.<br><br>interviewer: No, but for you it has the same epic qualities?<br><br>borges: I think it has, yes. During this century, as I say, the epic tradition has been saved for the world by, of all places, Hollywood. When I went to Paris, I felt I wanted to shock people, and when they asked me-they knew that I was interested in the films, or that I had been, because my eyesight is very dim now-and they asked me, "What kind of film do you like?" And I said, "Candidly, what I most enjoy are the Westerns." They were all Frenchmen; they fully agreed with me. They said, "Of course we see such films as Hiroshima, mon amour or L'Annï¿½e derniï¿½re ï¿½ Marienbad out of a sense of duty, but when we want to amuse ourselves, when we want to enjoy ourselves, when we want, well, to get a real kick, then we see American films."<br><br>interviewer: Then it is the content, the "literary" content of the film, rather than any of the technical aspects of the movies that interests you?<br><br>borges: I know very little about the technical part of movies.<br><br>interviewer: If I may change the subject to your own fiction, I would like to ask about your having said that you were very timid about beginning to write stories.<br><br>borges: Yes, I was very timid, because when I was young I thought of myself as a poet. So I thought: "If I write a story everybody will know I'm an outsider, that I am intruding in forbidden ground." Then I had an accident. You can feel the scar. If you touch my head here, you will see. Feel all those mountains, bumps? Then I spent a fortnight in a hospital. I had nightmares and sleeplessness-insomnia. After that they told me that I had been in danger, well, of dying, that it was really a wonderful thing that the operation had been successful. I began to fear for my mental integrity-I said, "Maybe I can't write anymore." Then my life would have been practically over, because literature is very important to me. Not because I think my own stuff particularly good, but because I know that I can't get along without writing. If I don't write, I feel, well, a kind of remorse, no? Then I thought I would try my hand at writing an article or a poem. But I thought: "I have written hundreds of articles and poems. If I can't do it, then I'll know at once that I am done for, that everything is over with me." So I thought I'd try my hand at something I hadn't done: if I couldn't do it, there would be nothing strange about it, because why should I write short stories?-It would prepare me for the final overwhelming blow: knowing that I was at the end of my tether. I wrote a story called, let me see, I think, "Hombre de la esquina rosada," and everyone enjoyed it very much. It was a great relief to me. If it hadn't been for that particular knock on the head I got, perhaps I would never have written short stories.</p><h2>Ask Your Angels : A Practical Guide to Working With Angels to Enrich Your Life</h2><p>Angels have been with us in every age and culture, and in many religions.

It attempts to be part social history and part cookery book, it sets out to describe the dishes - and the social conditions in which they were prepared, cooked and eaten - in the short span between the two world wars. It contains 200 recipes, mostly drawn from cookery books or from magazines of the period, from family sources or from talking to survivors who still remember those days. All the recipes have been tested and adapted, where necessary, for modern use. The dishes reflect the different trends from simple &#34;nursery dishes&#34; that were served in country houses, the elegant &#34;dinner party&#34; food that was popular with the London hostesses and the informal French cooking that also had its own following. This period of time was followed by almost 15 years of food rationing and restrictions, so that once freedom of choice was restored the English preferance was for something new. With the publication of Elizabeth David&#39;s first book in 1950, a passion for Mediterranean food swept the country. The author of this book is a former Food Writer for &#34;Vogue&#34; and the author of &#34;First Slice Your Cookbook&#34; and &#34;The Sunday Times Complete Cookbook&#34;.</p><p>Arabella Boxer was born in 1934 and educated in the UK, Paris and Rome. She has written for the Sunday Times magazine and the Telegraph magazine and was Food Writer for Vogue from 1966 to 1968 and 1975 to 1991. She was awarded the Glenfiddich Cookery Writer of the Year Award in 1975 and 1978, a Glenfiddich Special Award in 1992 and won the 1991 Andrï¿½ Simon Award and the 1992 Michael Smith Macallan Award for fine writing about British food. Arabella Boxer is the author of a number of cookery books, including First Slice Your Cookbook, Arabella Boxer&#39;s Garden Cookbook, Mediterranean Cookbook, The Sunday Times Complete Cookbook and A Visual Feast (with Tessa Traeger). A founding member of the Guild of Food Writers, she lives in London.</p><h2>The Fire and the Light: A Novel of the Cathars and the Lost Teachings of Christ</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note:</b> First edition hardback is out-of-print.

Current print version is the 2nd edition paperback (2015) Please refer to description and author information on that edition."Spanning roughly sixty years in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, this story portrays the spread and persecution of the Cathar faith in France. Considered heretics, the Cathars preached pacifism, ordained women, and were accused of practicing black magic because of their skill with healing. Esclarmonde de Foix starts out as a headstrong girl in the Toulousian Courts of Love, but after an encounter with a Cathar elder, finds herself increasingly drawn to the faith, and after undergoing certain spiritual trials, she eventually finds herself acting as the leader of the Cathars, dedicated to God and her people. Throughout, she struggles with her love for a Templar knight who often rescues her in times of need, but neither can choose their love over their faith without breaking sacred vows. <p>This book is clearly well-researched, but more importantly for a novel, it tells a thoroughly engrossing story. As Esclarmonde struggles with her faith and the war sweeping her country, Craney explores issues of theology, a variety of historical events and characters, forbidden love, and the strength and strain of family ties through war. Some of the battle and persecution scenes are quite gruesome as the depictions are quite true to life, and at times the language is a little overblown, making some scenes difficult to follow. Overall, though, this is a well-written and compellingly told story of a little-known figure from medieval France. </p><p>This book would appeal to those interested in medieval French history and readers who were intrigued by some of the historical underpinnings of Dan Brown's <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, and it is a well-told epic story of faith and love." ----Ann K.

Myers, <i>The Historical Novel Society Review</i></p></p><h2>Literary Women: The Great Writers</h2><p>One of the pioneering works of feminist criticism, <em>Literary Women</em> separates women from the mainstram of literary history and examines how the fact that they were women influenced both their lives and their writing.

In the 16th century the wealthy and powerful Medici family began amassing fine art and displaying it in the Uffizi, their showplace palace in the heart of Florence. Ruling Tuscany for another two centuries, the family continually enriched its holdings with works by the best European artists of the time, many of them commissioned or acquired from the artists themselves. When the collection was donated to the city of Florence in 1737, it was, in essence, given to the people, and this ensured that the collection would remain intact in its original building.<br>In this skillful and dazzling selection of paintings from the Galleria degli Uffizi are the greatest works by the early Renaissance artists-Giotto, Piero della Francesca, Mantegna, Botticelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael-and by the later Italians such as Caravaggio, Tiepolo, and Canaletto. Artists from throughout Europe are also well represented, among them Dï¿½rer, El Greco, Rubens, Velï¿½zquez, Rembrandt, Boucher, and Goya, in this tiny jewel of a book.</p><p></p><h2>Silver Jewelry Designs: Evaluating Quality : Good, Better, Best (A Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>The innovative designs in silver jewelry made in Europe and North America in the 20th century are fascinating and highly popular today.

This is the memoir that made her infamous&#x2014;a downfall chronicle of a private hell that could only have been written by someone with nothing left to lose.</p><p><b>Julia Phillips </b>was the Oscar-winning producer for&nbsp;<i>Taxi Driver</i>,&nbsp;<i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Sting.</i><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Prologue<br><br>House Lights Dim Before Titles<br><br>The Sting had been nominated, two months before, in ten categories, including Cinematography, Editing, Actor, Screenplay, Director, and Best Picture. The Exorcist, which had garnered an equal number of nominations, had been released the same day, two days before Christmas. It had received an enormous amount of initial publicity; even The New York Times carried pictures of people lined up in the cold to get in.<br><br>Warners had been far too cautious in its release of The Exorcist. It had opened in only twenty-four theaters. At 90/10 deals, Leo Greenfield kept reminding us. But then, he was the guy who told us, based on the first week&#x2019;s figures, that our picture would gross maybe fifteen mil. We had opened in 220 theaters, with 70/30 deals, and kept widening the release. Warners waited a good six weeks until they went wide. But The Exorcist was only a three-week picture; the audience lost interest before it was available.<br><br>The Sting, on the other hand, had staying power. It had hung in, week after week, and it had opened in ten times the number of theaters. Not only was The Sting racking up some very impressive figures, but people had started to notice that it was an excellent movie. It certainly didn&#x2019;t send you out in the street unsure whether to hit a church or a bar, as The Exorcist did. And Warners had a crack at The Sting and turned us down.<br><br>We&#x2019;d made damn sure John Calley and Dick Shepherd came to the one screening Universal permitted us before the release of the picture. As they were walking out, I collared Calley, because I knew how much it annoyed him, and asked him how he liked the picture.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going home to slash my wrists,&#x201d; he said. Good. Supercilious motherfucker.<br><br>It would be them or us tonight at the Awards.<br><br>Michael and Tony had spent weeks aggravating over whether The Sting would win for Best Picture or not. They had practiced speeches, how they would stand up, their walks to the stage. I hadn&#x2019;t dared to contemplate the possibility of winning. I was not a big believer in the power of positive thinking, although I had gone to college with Norman Vincent Peale&#x2019;s daughter. Didn&#x2019;t wanna put a mojo on it; didn&#x2019;t wanna tempt the evil eye.<br><br>I translated all my anxiety into finding a dress. Joel Schumacher was my fashion consultant. We agreed I was a New York girl, most comfortable in black, and since so many Californians dressed in colors, that I would probably stand out. Where I got the chutzpah to think I might stand out at such a gathering I don&#x2019;t know. We traipsed from store to store and I would try something on and I would say, &#x201c;Now if I win . . .&#x201d; and then see if the dress was comfortable to walk in, and he would pull at a strap and say, &#x201c;Now, when you win . . .&#x201d; We finally settled on a black spaghetti-strap number by Halston at Giorgio&#x2019;s, a long strand of pearls, and a double feather boa made up of guinea hen and black ostrich feathers.<br><br>I was still, six months after Kate&#x2019;s birth, a little wide in the hip. Joel was adamant that I should wear beautiful black sandal-heels but I couldn&#x2019;t find any tall enough. I needed height. I ended up buying a pair of giant platform shoes from Fred Slatten. Black satin with rhinestones. They stayed hidden under the dress and they definitely gave me height. They also filled me with the quiescent fear that I might actually fall off them on global TV. A toss-up, looks or safety. The hips won out.<br><br>Trancas, California<br><br>April 2, 1974<br><br>I wake with a shudder at six thirty. The sun creates hot bounce on the sky/sea horizon. It is quite a sight, but I take this view for granted. Without pausing a moment in sincere appreciation, I automatically pop a diet pill. Bad move. Within twenty minutes, I&#x2019;m dancing around the sandy living room, neatening up. I run along the beach, take a perfunctory dip in the freezing-cold Pacific, race indoors for a brief hot shower.<br><br>When I hit the bedroom, Michael is standing on his head, yoga-style, in the corner of the room. &#x201c;I gotta pick up my tuxedo,&#x201d; Michael says, still upside down. The veins in his temples explode and contract on each syllable. Upstairs, I hear Kate&#x2019;s first baby-musings for the day. Sonya heats formula in the kitchen. I can smell it. I don&#x2019;t know how Kate can stand that shit.<br><br>&#x201c;Good, that&#x2019;ll give me time to be nervous all by myself. Maybe Sonya could take Kate out for a while.&#x201d; As in: I. NEED. MY. SPACE . . . <br><br>Within the hour, they&#x2019;re toast. I lay out some coke on a small mirror. Secret stash. Mine. Michael doesn&#x2019;t even know I have it . . . that&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s gotten. I chop it lightly with a razor. It falls apart like butter. This is good coke. Smooth. I do a hit, then another. I roll a joint and smoke it out on the deck. Less than a hundred yards from me, the ocean beats down in heavy waves against the sand. I pace, my heart beating in triple time to the waves.<br><br>I watch the postal van ease its way toward our mailbox, and I vault over the deck and scramble down the hill to meet it. The mailman has a stack, bills mostly, junk mail addressed to Occupant. Sandwiched between the telephone bill and the latest issue of Time is a small blue envelope. The handwriting addressing Michael and Julia Phillips is familiar. I tear open the envelope as I return to the house, yelling &#x201c;Thanks&#x201d; over my shoulder to the mailman&#x2019;s wishes for our good luck that night. The letter is short and pithy, my favorites:<br><br>Dear Michael &amp; Julia:<br><br>In a few days, you will be getting cards and letters and telegrams from everyone, so I wanted to get in what I had to say now. The important thing to remember is that you are nice sweet people. You are about to have a lot of temptation thrown your way, so try not to forget that.<br><br>Love, John<br><br>Maybe too pithy. The letter upsets me; just now, Michael and I are nice sweet people to everybody but each other. Marriage . . . Here today, gone today. I pop half a Valium and look at my shaking hands. Shut up, I tell them.<br><br>When they do, I set about the arduous process of blow-drying my hair, then spicing it up with a curling iron. I swallow another three Valium halves and recurl my hair as a chaser each time until it is time to get dressed. After I&#x2019;m dressed, I have a little coke as a chaser for all that Val out of my secret stash. I don&#x2019;t offer Michael any. It would provoke a fight. I&#x2019;m not into fighting with Michael tonight.<br><br>Universal has been kind enough to provide a limousine for us and Tony and Antoinette Bill, and David Ward and his wife, Chris. When I first met Antoinette Bill, everybody called her Mrs. Tony. Her given name was Antoinette, but she had gone under the name Toni all her life. Tony, who was in actual fact nï¿½ Gerard Anthony Bill, was also called Tony. Somehow, Tony stayed and Toni became Mrs. Tony. I, of course, was outraged.<br><br>&#x201c;You sound like his chattel,&#x201d; I told her at lunch at Ma Maison one day. I had just had my lip and legs painfully waxed by Charlotte at Elizabeth Arden&#x2019;s, which was making me bristle. The fact that Patrick had the restaurant wrapped in polyethylene, something my father participated in inventing, and that it was a hot day with too little air conditioning, might also have added to my dyspeptic world-view. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there something else I can call you?&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled. &#x201c;Well, my real name is Antoinette, but I always thought it was pretentious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe when you were ten, but you&#x2019;re a grown-up married lady now with two kids and a husband named Gerard who likes to be called Tony, not that I blame him. I&#x2019;m gonna call you Antoinette from now on. Okay?&#x201d; I still asked permission in certain matters . . . <br><br>She grinned and flushed. &#x201c;Why not? What the hell!&#x201d; She laughed and toasted me with a glass of dry white wine.<br><br>I started calling her Antoinette; pretty soon some other people started calling her Antoinette; after a while everyone but Tony called her Antoinette. One day she went out and had her checks, credit cards, license, passport&#x2014;everything identifying her&#x2014;changed to Antoinette Bill. I felt as good that day as I did the day Michael&#x2019;s mother, Sherry, started getting paid for finding the dresses that Michael&#x2019;s father, Larry, knocked off in his lower-priced dress line. I was a fucking one-woman consciousness-raising session . . . <br><br>Michael and I have to be the first to leave because we&#x2019;re in Trancas, which is as far away from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion as you can be and still live in the county of L.A. David and Chris live in Topanga Canyon, so we pick them up on the way into town. There is something very silly about being all duded up at three o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, sitting in the back of a stretch limo, but the door will be closed, the Academy has reminded us in numerous missives preceding the event, at six thirty promptly.<br><br>We have already split up Bill/Phillips Productions and there&#x2019;s bad blood between Tony and us. This isn&#x2019;t to become known until we are. Tony decides to drive himself and meet us there. He doesn&#x2019;t want to be Hollywood and arrive in a limo. If you really feel that way, I think, why go at all? Because we&#x2019;re going to win. This concept makes me as nervous as the thought of losing.<br><br>A limo provided by the studio for the producers and the writer is a truly grandiose gesture, given all previous behavior by Universal. Basically we have been treated as a nasty inconvenience to be just barely tolerated. By Zanuck and Brown. By George Roy Hill. Mostly by those who live in the Black Tower, sometimes referred to locally as the Black Mariah, the reflector-sunglass mausoleum that houses all the Universal Executives, both living and dead. To them, our youth, so chic at some of the other studios, is an impudence.<br><br>The day the nominations came out, and both those who had made American Graffiti and The Sting, a ubiquitously young group, had snagged an incredible number of honors for Universal, we received telegrams from the top two execs at Universal: Lew Wasserman and Sid Sheinberg.<br><br>SINCEREST CONGRATULATIONS AND BEST WISHES FROM ALL OF US AT UNIVERSAL FOR TEN ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS, INCLUDING BEST PICTURE, FOR THE STING. LEW R. WASSERMAN<br><br>Not warm, but essentially correct.<br><br>CONGRATULATIONS FOR THE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATION FOR AMERICAN GRAFFITI. THE FILM IN OUR JUDGEMENT IS AN AMERICAN CLASSIC AND DESERVING OF ALL OF ITS ACCOLADES. LET&#x2019;S HOPE THERE ARE OTHER VENTURES THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. SID SHEINBERG<br><br>Not warm, and incorrect in all its essentials.<br><br>I have this image of Sid&#x2019;s secretary: Well, all young people look alike, don&#x2019;t they? I&#x2019;ve always wondered if the message Western Unioned to George Lucas congratulated him on the receipt of so many nominations for The Sting. I wonder if he kept his, too . . . <br><br>And now, here we are: Chris and David and Michael and Julia, flying along the Pacific Coast Highway, compliments of Universal Airlines, to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. I have nibbled another half a Valium at the Wards&#x2019;. I&#x2019;ve decided it&#x2019;s okay to carry Valium to the Academy Awards. Most of the people in the Academy are from the Valium-and-Alcohol Generation. I&#x2019;m becoming a tad too relaxed behind it, though. Sleepy might be a better word.<br><br>Need a little hit, I think, as my head lolls around on my neck. Need a big hit, I amend. You have a big hit. The Sting . . . Not that kind of a hit . . . maybe coffee. If nothing else was around. I&#x2019;m pissed at myself for leaving my secret stash behind. I focus on getting downtown, like that&#x2019;s going to make the drive quicker.<br><br>By the time we reach the exit to the Music Center, limousines are backed up onto the ramp. Behind us they stack up quickly. Limos to the left of me, limos to the right. A limo! A limo! My kingdom for a limo! It is a boiling-hot day and all the air conditioners are blasting. The hot and the cold mingles with the poisonous air; the exhaust makes a greenish brown cloud that hangs over us. I feel I am in line for the funeral of the most popular guy in Hollywood. Who could that be, I wonder . . . <br><br>The limousines, the cloud, the heat, make me think: We are all going to die. A thought I have two, maybe three hundred times a day anyway. I concentrate on Life and it makes me realize I have to pee semi-badly. At the rate we&#x2019;re moving, I won&#x2019;t get to check my makeup. I know the only part of my face that is glowing with health right now is my shiny forehead.<br><br>It&#x2019;s ridiculous to worry about how I look. There&#x2019;s a long red carpet; it is the only route to the door. The door that closes promptly at six thirty! There are barricades and cops and fans and photographers. Everywhere. We do not rate a flicker. There is nothing quite like being the only unknown in a bevy of luminaries. Unless it is to be the only name at a gathering of nobodies. If I had to vote for the lesser of two evils, as I do for my president, I&#x2019;d go with anonymity. But I didn&#x2019;t know that then.<br><br>We walk along that red carpet, graced by Sally Kellerman in front of us and Paul and Linda McCartney behind us. Nobody reaches out to us. No Army Archerd interview. No hail-fellow-well-met interchange with milling celebs. An all-time Humbler. A year or two before, I&#x2019;d have been amazed to be here. Now that I am, I can see that the only way to attend one of these events is as a star. We traverse the gauntlet in that casual way that says: I don&#x2019;t care to be noticed. I feel like a walk-on in a high-school play.<br><br>Of course, Tony and Antoinette are here already. We see Tony chatting up Steve Shagan, who&#x2019;s in competition with David Ward for Best Screenplay, and drinking, from the look around his mouth, his third glass of wine. He looks pretty cool in his tux. He looks like he belongs. Shagan insincerely wishes us luck. That&#x2019;s okay, I forgive him. He&#x2019;s insisted we hire Norman Garey, who acts as our lawyer and is truly our friend. I shift back and forth, no small feat on platforms four inches from the ground in the toe and probably six in the heel. It gives me the illusion that I am taking steps, presumably away, from a situation that makes me uncomfortable.</p><h2>BIRTH REBORN</h2><p>The internationally known French physician and head of the Pithiviers Maternity Clinic in northern France explains his revolutionary natural childbirth methods, which result in some of the lowest infant mortality figures in the world</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Cambodia &amp; Laos</h2><p><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: The Caribbean</i> will lead you straight to the best attractions this island paradise has to offer.

This infamous event is made emotionally clear through his meeting a group of children all with strange name tags pinned to their coats. The man feels the helplessness of the children. Finally, desperately he releases the name tags like birds into the air to find their way home with the hope for a time when Americans will be seen as one people&#x2014;not judged, mistrusted, or segregated because of their individual heritage.<br> Sixty years after thousands of Japanese Americans were unjustly imprisoned, the cogent prose and haunting paintings of renowned author and illustrator Allen Say remind readers of a dark chapter in America&#x2019;s history.</p><p><p>Allen Say was born in Yokohama, Japan, in 1937. He dreamed of becoming a cartoonist from the age of six, and, at age twelve, apprenticed himself to his favorite cartoonist, Noro Shinpei. For the next four years, Say learned to draw and paint under the direction of Noro, who has remained Say's mentor. Say illustrated his first children's book -- published in 1972 -- in a photo studio between shooting assignments. For years, Say continued writing and illustrating children's books on a part-time basis. But in 1987, while illustrating THE BOY OF THE THREE-YEAR NAP (Caldecott Honor Medal), he recaptured the joy he had known as a boy working in his master's studio. It was then that Say decided to make a full commitment to doing what he loves best: writing and illustrating children's books. Since then, he has written and illustrated many books, including TREE OF CRANES and GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY, winner of the 1994 Caldecott Medal. He is a full-time writer and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon.</p>Breaking from such previous works as Tea with Milk and Grandfather's Journey, which featured a realistic sequence of events, Caldecott Medalist Say here enters the realm of dream or rather, nightmare. The opening image shows a man dwarfed by an ominous, craggy stone edifice at the edge of a shore, as he prepares to step into his kayak. In the next spread, the man, wearing a red helmet and vest that match his vessel, hurls over a waterfall; the sky resembles billowing black smoke that blends with the rocky cliffs ("The man closed his eyes and held his breath"). Say's use of light and dark has a haunting effect, as the man first surfaces in an underground tunnel with a faint glimmer of sunlight; the light then shifts from horizontal to vertical as it illuminates a ladder. Barren land awaits above, with a single structure: "Must be an Indian reservation, he thought." Two children sit against an adobe ruin with nametags around their necks, explaining they are "from the camp." Details in the meticulously rendered watercolors reveal that the children are referring to an internment camp: a row of abandoned identical wooden houses sit on the desert floor of a valley (and hark back to the deserted Indian reservation); thousands of children with identical tags chant "Take us home!"; searchlights from high watchtowers follow them as they flee. Other details link the hero's fate with theirs, but the final image is uplifting. Much remains enigmatic: most children will require the aid of an older reader to make sense of the historical context, and may be put off by the dark and lonely vistas. However, the images create an internal logic of their own, as emotionally convincing as any waking experience. All ages. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Gayer-Anderson Cat (Object in Focus)</h2><p>The Gayer-Anderson Cat has been one of the most admired objects at the British Museum since its arrival in 1947.

The images on the front and back of this jacket show the two faces of Cleopatra -the Egyptian living goddess and the Macedonian queen. Highly intelligent, Cleopatra spoke many languages and was rumoured to be the only Ptolemy to read and speak Egyptian. Her famous liaisons with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony were as much to do with politics as the heart. Ruthless in dealing with her enemies, many within her own family, Cleopatra steered her kingdom through difficult times. She very nearly succeeded in creating an eastern empire to rival the growing might of Rome. Stripping away our preconceptions, many of them as old as Egypt&#39;s Roman conquerors, Joyce Tyldesley uses all her skills as an Egytologist to give us a rich picture of a country and its Egyptian queen in this engrossing biography.</p><p>Joyce Tyldesley&#39;s books include acclaimed biographies of Rameses the Great, and the Queens Hatchepsut and Nefertiti, and of Egypt: How a Lost Civilization was Rediscovered, which accompanied a major BBC television series. They have been published all over the world. She lives in Bolton, Lancashire.Starred Review. This entertaining biography hits the elusive sweet spot between scholarship and readability. British archeologist Tyldesley (<i>Daughters of Isis</i>) is charmingly transparent about the unreliability of her sources. She tells us that when the Roman poet Lucan describes Cleopatra's ineffable night of shame with Julius Caesar, he is writing the equivalent of modern tabloid journalism. In spite of the lack of eyewitness descriptions of Cleopatra, the question, for instance, of what she looked like becomes a fast-moving amusing discussion of statuary as royal propaganda, the modern perception of Cleopatra's nose as way too big and the difference between beauty and sexiness. Writing with an easy mastery of her subject, Tyldesley always seems to be able to lay her hands on the perfect lively detail, whether an excerpt from an obscure bureaucratic document or a description of a kind of giant robot that paraded through the streets of Alexandria pouring libations of milk from a gold bottle. Though she makes it clear we'll never know what Cleopatra was really like, Tyldesley provides a memorable journey through the rich and contradictory sources of our knowledge about her. 8 pages of illus., 3 maps. <i>(Sept.)</i> ""<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lowry&#x2019;s contention was that the system failed the children it was meant to help because it placed them according to creed and convenience, not according to need. The plaintiff was thirteen-year-old Shirley Wilder, an abused runaway whose childhood had been shaped by the system&#x2019;s inequities. Within a year Shirley would give birth to a son and relinquish him to the same failing system. <br><br>Seventeen years later, with Wilder still controversial and still in court, Nina Bernstein tried to find out what had happened to Shirley and her baby. She was told by child-welfare officials that Shirley had disappeared and that her son was one of thousands of anonymous children whose circumstances are concealed by the veil of confidentiality that hides foster care from public scrutiny. But Bernstein persevered. <br><br><i>The Lost Children of Wilder</i> gives us, in galvanizing and compulsively readable detail, the full history of a case that reveals the racial, religious, and political fault lines in our child-welfare system, and lays bare the fundamental contradiction at the heart of our well-intended efforts to sever the destiny of needy children from the fate of their parents. Bernstein takes us behind the scenes of far-reaching legal and legislative battles, at the same time as she traces, in heartbreaking counterpoint, the consequences as they are played out in the life of Shirley&#x2019;s son, Lamont. His terrifying journey through the system has produced a man with deep emotional wounds, a stifled yearning for family, and a son growing up in the system&#x2019;s shadow. <br><br>In recounting the failure of the promise of benevolence, <i>The Lost Children of Wilder</i> makes clear how welfare reform can also damage its <br>intended beneficiaries. A landmark achievement of investigative reporting and a tour de force of social observation, this book will haunt every reader who cares about the needs of children.</p><p>At age 12, Shirley Wilder ran away from an abusive home and landed in New York City's foster-care system. By age 13, she was named the plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit that challenged the city's 150-year-old system as unconstitutional. At 14, Shirley gave birth to a son, Lamont, who was soon swept up in the same system. This absorbing account by <i>New York Times</i> reporter Nina Bernstein follows the threads of the tragic lives of Shirley and Lamont Wilder and the lawsuit that bears their name. In the process it illuminates the city's--and the nation's--dysfunctional social welfare system and its impact on the children it purportedly helps. <p> The Wilder lawsuit was filed in 1973 by a passionate young lawyer who stuck by it through 26 years of litigation, without the case ever being fully resolved. The accusation: that New York City's system violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments for giving private religious agencies control of publicly financed foster-care beds. These mostly Catholic and Jewish agencies gave preference to white Catholic and Jewish children, while the growing numbers of black and Protestant children were sent to inappropriate institutions that left them with more problems than they had when they came. Such was the fate of Shirley, who, for lack of anywhere else to go, was placed in Hudson, a state reformatory for delinquents with no treatment services for abandoned or abused children. Hudson "looked like a camp from the outside and was unmistakably a prison within." There was rampant violence and sexual abuse, and girls were regularly punished by being put in "the hole," a 5-by-8-foot cell with no windows, furniture, or heat, which Shirley would later testify was like "Winter. Winter--all year round." But a case that named state and city officials, 77 voluntary agencies and their directors, and 84 individual defendants including nuns, rabbis, and clergymen, and that threatened to pit blacks and Jews against each other, was a case destined to enter a legal wilderness of avoidance and delay. </p><p> Shirley and Lamont's unforgettable stories reveal the deep fault lines in a system that often does more harm than good. While reforms come and go with little success, Bernstein makes clear that the child welfare system will never really change until there is a coming to terms with the system's place as "a political battleground for abiding national conflicts over race, religion, gender and inequality" and the "unacknowledged contradictions between policies that punish the 'undeserving poor' and pledge to help all needy children." <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>"Nina Bernstein's fine reporting is more like archaeology. She searched down through layer after layer to show how the foster care system failed children, one generation after the next. ``The Lost Children of Wilder'' is a brilliant reconstruction of all the problems illuminated by a long-running lawsuit that makes Dickens' Jarndyce v. Jarndyce look swift and just."--Ellen Goodman, <i>New York Daily News</i><br><br>&#x201c;Nina Bernstein has pulled off a remarkable feat of reporting and storytelling that pushes us to reconsider how we handle children who are without home or family. A disturbing and riveting narrative that should be required reading for anyone who professes concern for children.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Alex Kotlowitz, author of <i>There Are No Children Here</i><br><br>&#x201c;This book joins a powerful analysis of law as an engine of social change with the fascinating story of the lives of a mother and son caught in the web of foster care and child-welfare agencies. Bernstein captures all the import and meaning of a legal case that split the philanthropic and civil liberties communities like no other. The Lost Children of Wilder is insightful and riveting, illuminating both the political and the personal.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;David Rothman, author of <i>The Discovery of the Asylum</i><br><br></p><h2>Friends of the Horseclans</h2><p>The exploits and epic adventures of the Horseclans are chronicled in twelve tales by such distinguished science fiction authors as Robert Adams, Joel Rosenberg, Andre Norton, George Alec Effinger and John F.

Largely self-taught, West developed his knowledge of ancient oriental languages in India, where he worked as a civil engineer. After returning to Europe, West focused on the study of sacred Zoroastrian texts and prepared these translations of Pahlavi manuscripts. His writings and editions are still referenced today in Indo-Iranian studies. Volume 5 contains translations of the Dï¿½nkard (books 7 and 5) and Selections of Zï¿½d-sparam. Some parts of these texts are prophetic, and West&#39;s introductory analysis provides an insight into the chronology of Zoroastrianism, which suggests that Zoroaster was born in 660 BCE and that the world will come to an end in 2398 CE.</p><p>Volume 5 of Pahlavi Texts was published in 1897 and includes texts from the Dï¿½nkard and Selections of Zï¿½d-sparam relating legendary marvels from creation to resurrection. West&#39;s translations of these texts offer easy access to the most valuable sources for Zoroaster&#39;s life and a prophetic chronology of the faith.</p><h2>Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia</h2><p>For the decade that followed the end of the cold war, the world was lulled into a sense that a consumerist, globalized, peaceful future beckoned. The beginning of the twenty-first century has rudely disposed of such ideas&#x2014;most obviously through 9/11and its aftermath. But just as damaging has been the rise in the West of a belief that a single model of political behavior will become a worldwide norm and that, if necessary, it will be enforced at gunpoint.&nbsp;In <i>Black Mass</i>, celebrated philosopher and critic John Gray explains how utopian ideals have taken on a dangerous significance in the hands of right-wing conservatives and religious zealots. He charts the history of utopianism, from the Reformation through the French Revolution and into the present. And most&nbsp; urgently, he describes how utopian politics have moved from the extremes of the political spectrum into mainstream politics, dominating the administrations of both George W. Bush and Tony Blair, and indeed coming to define the political center. Far from having shaken off discredited ideology, Gray suggests, we are more than ever in its clutches. <i>Black Mass </i>is a truly frightening and challenging work by one of Britain&#x2019;s leading political thinkers. <b>John Gray&nbsp;</b>is the author of many critically acclaimed books, including <i>Straw Dogs </i>and <i>Al Qaeda and What It Means to Be Modern</i>.

"'Modern politics is a chapter in the history of religion,' Gray, a British philosopher, insists in this outspoken attack on utopianism and the &#x2018;faith-based violence&#x2019; it has inspired.

Any book that herds Robespierre, Lenin, radical Islamists and neoconservatives into one conceptual corral doesn't lack for audacity. While Gray covers a lot of ground, tracing millenarian thinking from early Christianity to the present, he mainly sets his sights on the American neoconservative project to export free-market capitalism and liberal democracy&#x2014;at the point of a gun if necessary . . . The story line of <i>Black Mass </i>goes like this: Christianity bequeathed to the West the idea of apocalypse, a violent event in history that transforms everything and remakes the world. That idea wormed its way into our DNA, so to speak, and has been there ever since . . . Gray is not the first to see the Iraq War as rooted in a naive right-wing utopianism. What's impressive is the way he embeds present political trends in a larger framework going back to the beginnings of Western culture . . . [T]he book challenges and provokes. For most readers, I suspect, it will tell them things they didn't know.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Fritz Lanham, <i>Houston Chronicle</i> <br><br></b>"A limpidly argued and finely written synthesis of Gray's thinking over the decade or so since <i>False Dawn</i>, his highly regarded and influential study of globalisation. It is not a cheering work, to say the least, and Gray's conclusions, though never exaggerated or overstated, are bleak . . . Yet the right expression of even the bleakest truths is always invigorating, and any half-sensible reader will come away from the book soberer and even, perhaps, wiser." &#x2014;<b>John Banville, <i>The Guardian<br></i></b><b><i><br></i></b>"Gray is right to scoff at the misplaced faith in progress propounded by Enlightenment philosophers . . . Gray reminds us about more ancient and truthful myths, which predicted that our reckless pursuit of knowledge and power would lead to disaster." &#x2014;<b>Peter Conrad, <i>The Observer<br><br></i></b>"When the fashionable pundits of the age of globalization are as forgotten as those who, in the run-up to World War I, predicted globalization had rendered war obsolete, John Gray's work will still matter. It is at once a reproof and an antidote to the reigning wishful thinking that makes Voltaire's Dr. Pangloss look like a realist. Gray's work has always been about separating reality and delusion. In <i>Black Mass</i>, Gray dissects the greatest of all political delusions--utopianism--and maps the way in which, against all expectations, it has migrated from left to right, from communism to neo-conservatism. This is that rarest of things, a <i>necessary</i> book." &#x2014;<b>David Rieff<br><br></b>&#x201c;Seeing history as a progressive narrative, especially one with a utopian ending, is a practice that has doomed earlier civilizations and threatens our own, argues Gray.

The greatest of the revolutionary upheavals that have shaped so much of the history of the past two centuries were episodes in the history of faith &#x2013; moments in the long dissolution of Christianity and the rise of modern political religion. The world in which we find ourselves at the start of the new millennium is littered with the debris of utopian projects, which though they were framed in secular terms that denied the truth of religion were in fact vehicles for religious myths.<br>Communism and Nazism claimed to be based on science &#x2013; in the case of communism the cod-science of historical materialism, in Nazism the farrago of &#x2018;scientific racism&#x2019;. These claims were fraudulent but the use of pseudo-science did not stop with the collapse of totalitarianism that culminated with the dissolution of the USSR in<br>December 1991. It continued in neo-conservative theories that claimed the world is converging on a single type of government and economic system &#x2013; universal democracy, or a global free market. Despite the fact that it was presented in the trappings of social science, this belief that humanity was on the brink of a new era was only the most recent version of apocalyptic beliefs that go back to the most ancient times.<br>Jesus and his followers believed they lived in an End-Time when <br>the evils of the world were about to pass away. Sickness and death, famine and hunger, war and oppression would all cease to exist after a world-shaking battle in which the forces of evil would be utterly destroyed. Such was the faith that inspired the first Christians, and though the End-Time was re-interpreted by later Christian thinkers as a metaphor for a spiritual change, visions of Apocalypse have haunted western life ever since those early beginnings.<br>During the Middle Ages, Europe was shaken by mass movements inspired by the belief that history was about to end and a new world be born. These medieval Christians believed that only God could bring about the new world, but faith in the End-Time did not wither away when Christianity began to decline. On the contrary, as Christianity waned the hope of an imminent End-Time became stronger and more militant. Modern revolutionaries such as the French Jacobins and the Russian Bolsheviks detested traditional religion, but their conviction that the crimes and follies of the past could be left behind in an all-encompassing transformation of human life was a secular reincarnation of early Christian beliefs. These modern revolutionaries were radical exponents of Enlightenment thinking, which aimed to replace religion with a scientific view of the world. Yet the radical Enlightenment belief that there can be a sudden break in history, after which the flaws of human society will be for ever abolished, is a by-product of Christianity.<br>The Enlightenment ideologies of the past centuries were very largely spilt theology. The history of the past century is not a tale of secular advance, as bien-pensants of Right and Left like to think. The Bolshevik and Nazi seizures of power were faith-based upheavals just as much as the Ayatollah Khomeini&#x2019;s theocratic insurrection in Iran. The very idea of revolution as a transforming event in history is owed to religion. Modern revolutionary movements are a continuation of religion by other means.<br>It is not only revolutionaries who have held to secular versions of religious beliefs. So too have liberal humanists, who see progress as a slow incremental struggle. The belief that the world is about to end and belief in gradual progress may seem to be opposites &#x2013; one looking forward to the destruction of the world, the other to its improvement &#x2013; but at bottom they are not so different. Whether they stress piecemeal change or revolutionary transformation, theories of progress are not scientific hypotheses. They are myths, which answer the human need for meaning.<br>Since the French Revolution a succession of utopian movements has transformed political life. Entire societies have been destroyed and the world changed for ever. The alteration envisioned by utopian thinkers has not come about, and for the most part their projects have produced results opposite to those they intended. That has not prevented similar projects being launched again and again right up to the start of the twenty-first century, when the world&#x2019;s most powerful state launched a campaign to export democracy to the Middle East and throughout the world.<br>Utopian projects reproduced religious myths that had inflamed mass movements of believers in the Middle Ages, and they kindled a similar violence. The secular terror of modern times is a mutant version of the violence that has accompanied Christianity throughout its history. For over 200 years the early Christian faith in an End-Time initiated by God was turned into a belief that Utopia could be achieved by human action. Clothed in science, early Christian myths of Apocalypse gave rise to a new kind of faith-based violence.<br>When the project of universal democracy ended in the bloodsoaked streets of Iraq, this pattern began to be reversed. Utopianism suffered a heavy blow, but politics and war have not ceased to be vehicles for myth. Instead, primitive versions of religion are replacing the secular faith that has been lost. Apocalyptic religion shapes the policies of American president George W. Bush and his antagonist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran. Wherever it is happening,<br>the revival of religion is mixed up with political conflicts, including an intensifying struggle over the Earth&#x2019;s shrinking reserves of natural resources; but there can be no doubt that religion is once again a power in its own right. With the death of Utopia, apocalyptic religion has re-emerged, naked and unadorned, as a force in world politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Excerpted from Black Mass by John Gray. Copyright ï¿½ 2007 by John Gray.

Bear doesn't like anything about Mrs. Ducknot her floppy hat, or her beady eyes, or her fat, fluffy tail. All he intends to do, no matter what she suggests, is sit and wait for Nora to come home. However, this quickly becomes boring, and Mrs. Duck lures him into first drawing pictures, then reading a favorite book. She flaps up to the top shelf to get it, and floats down again. "Wow," says Bear. She plays roll-the-ball by dipping upside down. And she can retrieve a stray sailboat by paddling over to it. Most important, she doesn't try to argue with him when he is feeling bad. When Nora comes home, Bear is relieved and happy, but doesn't seem to mind the idea of Mrs. Duck's next visit. Brewster's pastels push this sweetly winning story along; this is a good book for helping children ease into the idea of separation from their parents. Ages 3-8. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 1 Through alliterative text; gentle humor; and soft, billowy illustrations, Winthrop and Brewster show exactly how most young children feel about being left with a babysitter. Bear resents being left with Mrs. Duck while Nora goes to the store, and he's determined to be miserable. However, Mrs. Duck, no amateur at dealing with children, has some surprises in store for him, and by the time she leaves, he's looking forward to another visit with her. Mrs. Duck, with her ample squat size, looks a bit like a big comfortable pillow, and Bear is perfectly childlike in his uncertainty, hostility, slow acceptance, and final approval. Children are sure to recognize themselves in the story, as it expertly captures all of the stages of the relationship through dialogue and facial expressions. A real charmer that's honest and realistic in its depiction of a childhood trauma, it neatly combines imagination and reassurance with good fun.

Should the forty-fifth president of the United States make us reconsider the nature and future of the global order? Collecting a wide range of perspectives from leading political scientists, historians, and international-relations scholars, <i>Chaos in the Liberal Order</i> explores the global trends that led to Trump&#x2019;s stunning victory and the impact his presidency will have on the international political landscape.<br><br>Contributors situate Trump among past foreign policy upheavals and enduring models for global governance, seeking to understand how and why he departs from precedents and norms. The book considers key issues, such as what Trump means for America&#x2019;s role in the world; the relationship between domestic and international politics; and Trump&#x2019;s place in the rise of the far right worldwide. It poses challenging questions, including: Does Trump&#x2019;s election signal the downfall of the liberal order or unveil its resilience? What is the importance of individual leaders for the international system, and to what extent is Trump an outlier? Is there a Trump doctrine, or is America&#x2019;s president fundamentally impulsive and scattershot? The book considers the effects of Trump&#x2019;s presidency on trends in human rights, international alliances, and regional conflicts. With provocative contributions from prominent figures such as Stephen M. Walt, Andrew J. Bacevich, and Samuel Moyn, this timely collection brings much-needed expert perspectives on our tumultuous era.</p><p>Robert Jervis is the Adlai E.

Nineteenth-century naturalists struggled to classify the platypus and the little animal excited curiosity and sparked fierce debate in international scientific circles. This volume presents the enigmatic story of a biological riddle that confounded scientists for many years, challenging theories of creationism, evolution and the classification of species along the way.</p><p>Consider the platypus, that curious Australian creature that seems neither fish nor reptile nor mammal, but that has characteristics seemingly borrowed from all over the animal kingdom. Charles Darwin certainly considered it, puzzling over the platypus in the light of the rest of the world's creatures, and remarking, "Surely two distinct Creators must have been at work."<p> Australian historian of science Ann Moyal offers plenty of natural-historical information on the platypus in this slender, enjoyable book. What's more, she examines the sometimes shocked reactions the platypus inspired in European naturalists when they first saw specimens of the creature at the dawn of the 19th century. For, Moyal writes, the platypus almost single-handedly (or, perhaps better, single-web-footedly) overturned the prevailing classification of animals according to great-chain-of-being models; with its hodgepodge of physical traits and behaviors, it offered "an unexpected bridge between the categories of mammal/quadruped and reptiles and birds." That bridge helped set evolutionary theory on a new course; as Moyal writes, the platypus played an explicit role in Charles Darwin's ideas on isolation, species diversity, and natural selection, and he branded it a prime example of a "living fossil" that had managed to find an unoccupied ecological niche and live, relatively undisturbed, while fellow creatures marched toward extinction.</p><p> Scientists continue to study the platypus, Moyal writes in closing, for its remarkable traits, including a seeming sixth sense that helps it locate its prey in the underwater darkness. Her graceful book sheds new light on the history of biology and ought to earn <i>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</i> many new admirers. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Ann Moyal is a well-known historian of Australian science and has held research and teaching positions at a number of Australian universities. She has written many books and articles and is founder and past-president of the Independent Scholars Association of Australia.

Al Burt has a masterpiece here."--Sandra Bogan, Florida Audubon Society</p><p><br>From the preface:<br>"The Tropic of Cracker survives in myth, memory, and love of natural Florida. It exists more in the mind than in geography, more in the memory than in the sight, more in attitude than in the encounter. . . . This book tells you about one man&#x2019;s vision of a state struggling to remain true to itself. It mixes new essays with a span of earlier ones written during nearly a quarter century of roving the state as a columnist for the <i>Miami Herald</i>. All of them, in sum, help illuminate and explain the Tropic of Cracker."--Al Burt</p><p><br>The crack of the old-time cow hunter&#x2019;s whip gave the native Floridian a nickname, but Al Burt&#x2019;s <i>Tropic of Cracker</i> is a state of mind shared by those who love "what remains of the Florida that needed no blueprint or balance sheet for its creation, that was here before there was a can opener or a commercial or a real-estate agent."<br>&nbsp;In his years of roving the state as a <i>Miami Herald</i> columnist, Al Burt mapped Florida&#x2019;s Tropic of Cracker, not with lines of latitude and longitude but with stories.<br>&nbsp;The Crackers Burt tells of are men and women from Apalachicola to the Everglades, from Tallahassee to the Keys. They lived in the late 1800s, and they live today--along the Ocklawaha and in the floodplains of Lake Okeechobee. They were cow hunters, Conchs, and alligator men. They grew oranges, sugarcane, and muscadine grapes. They made moonshine. They drove mules, ate fried mullet, and told yarns in a Cracker creole about Florida&#x2019;s panthers, snakes, alligators, and hurricanes. There are luminaries among them--Zora Neale Hurston, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Virgil Hawkins, John DeGrove, Harry Crews--but mostly they are just regular folk who mark the borders of the elusive and magical Tropic of Cracker. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;For anyone who loves the old Florida and still has hope for the new one, <i>Tropic of Cracker</i> is the state&#x2019;s truest road map and Al Burt its most eloquent cartographer.</p><p>Al Burt worked as a journalist for 45 years, the last 22 at the <i>Miami Herald</i>.

Perhaps most impressive, he brings these endangered subcultures to life without resorting to sensationalist caricature or lapsing into nostalgic revery.

Inside were rare photographs and more than 100 revealing letters from the legendary pilot to her beloved mother. The first was a four-year-old's thank-you note. The last, three short lines, was written just prior to her final 1937 flight, when she vanished into a Pacific mist of conjecture. Fitted together they portray the remarkable evolution from child to adult of a warm, sensible, fun-loving tomboy whose rare determination and bravery led her to become the first woman to fly the Atlantic solo.<br><br>Although the letters shed no new light on the mystery of her last mission, they magnificently uncover the sou of a very private person who became one of the most acclaimed public figures of her day. She was a feminist who met with kings and princes but for all her blazing accomplishments still was down-to-earth enough to write to her mother</p><p></p><h2>CONSENSUAL SADOMASOCHISM</h2><p>Easy to read, easy to follow, and easy to understand, in this book the authors define and demystify the unique language of consensual sadomasochism, examine the psychological power of erotic dominance and submission, provide a carefully considered guide for safe SM play, and explain how SM can be an activity of intense intimacy and sophisticated erotic theater, as well as one of simple sexual pleasure. Combining their extensive professional credentials with deep personal experience, the result is an original introduction to a widely misunderstood realm of human sexuality. <p>"Henkin and Holiday have done erotic explorers a wonderful favor. Their useful book is concise and clearheaded in all things SM. But the most radical concept for many will surely be the notion to simply have fun." - Mark Thompson, editor of Leatherfolk </p><p>I've actually recomended this book more often than my own. That's because you're holding what is without doubt, one of the finest and most useful books on BDSM ever written. It can help you distinguish between looking and seeing. Not for skimmers........this one is soul food. - Guy Baldwin, M.S. author of TIES THAT BIND and SlaveCraft </p><p>Henkin and Holiday offer a very useful book about BDSM for mainly beginners in the scene but also for anyone who just like staying on top of opinions about BDSM. The book is well organized with a glossary right after a good discussion of special terms used in BDSM. Likewise sample negotiation forms are found at the end of the chapter where the procedure is explained. The largest section of the book concerns safety but not necessarily the kind you might find in "On the Safe Edge" or "Learning the Ropes". Here the focus is on learning about yourself first, learning about your partner second, and then how to explore BDSM. Throughout the idea that BDSM is primarily a pleasureable partnership is embraced and indeed in my personal experiences the best SM or Ds relationships are partnerships. Neither Henkin nor Holiday say that their way is the only way but they give solid reasons for their opinions and make suggestions based on years in the scene and as scholars and educators. This is definately a book I have proud to have in my library and one I recommend to people new to BDSM. - TammyJo Eckhart from kinkybooks.com</p></p><p>Changes: An Introduction to the Second (Revised) Edition <p>In 1996, when Consensual Sadomasochism first appeared, participant literature about BDSM was still fairly rare. Yet the field was clearly growing, and partly for that reason we did not conceive of our contribution as an introductory text, but rather as something that could accompany or follow the various fine SM primers that had recently come on the market, including Race Bannon&#x2019;s Learning the Ropes, Patrick Califia&#x2019;s Sensuous Magic, and Jay Wiseman&#x2019;s SM 101. </p><p>Revising our book at the sunrise of a new century, our purpose has not changed. But the SM community has changed remarkably since 1996, and so has its literature. It would take a volume beyond the scope of ours to document all those changes, but a few brief observations pertain to this book. </p><p>In 1996 San Francisco was still pretty much the red hot center of American SM, at least on the west coast, though not nearly to the extent it had been a decade and two decades earlier. But still there were just a handful of SM activities each month here &#x2013; a few meetings, a few parties, classes that were beginning to burgeon. As we write now, on the cusp of 2003/4, you could attend a different SM event pretty much every night of the year in the San Francisco Bay Area and still not take in everything. </p><p>To keep our observations current, as well as our information, we&#x2019;ve updated our glossary, tweaked many pages, revised our Resources section, and completely redone our information on Cyber SM. We&#x2019;ve also added a few new sections for this edition, including some pages on "How to Find an SM-Positive (or Neutral) Therapist," "Monogamous SM Relationships," and "Aftercare."</p>William A.

Ever since the <i>Codex Seraphinianus</i> was first published in 1981, the book has been recognized as one of the strangest and most beautiful art books ever made. This visual encyclopedia of an unknown world written in an unknown language has fueled much debate over its meaning. Written for the information age and addressing the import of coding and decoding in genetics, literary criticism, and computer science, the <i>Codex</i> confused, fascinated, and enchanted a generation. <br><br>While its message may be unclear, its appeal is obvious: it is a most exquisite artifact. Blurring the distinction between art book and art object, this anniversary edition-redesigned by the author and featuring new illustrations-presents this unique work in a new, unparalleled light. With the advent of new media and forms of communication and continuous streams of information, the <i>Codex</i> is now more relevant and timely than ever. A special limited and numbered deluxe edition that includes a signed print is also available.</p><p><b>Luigi Serafini</b> is an architect, ceramist, glazier, painter, sculptor, designer, opera director, set designer, and critic who works in Italy and abroad. In 2007, the Padiglione d'Arte Contemporanea in Milan dedicated a successful <i>mostra ontological</i> (ontological exhibition) to him. He has illustrated works by Franz Kafka and Michael Ende.&#x201c;...the book really does live up to its reputation: The drawings are in turn hilarious, disturbing, bizarre and, sometimes, just flat-out incomprehensible, but all of them are annotated in Serafini&#x2019;s script.&#x201d; -<i>Dangerous Minds<br></i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the sort of thing that easily lends itself to classification, but probably the most accurate way to describe it would be as an encyclopedia of an invented alien civilization...the Codex is still a disorienting and provocative vision of inscrutable otherness.&#x201d; -<i>Slate.com<br></i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<i>Codex Seraphinianus</i> is an art book in the most direct sense&#x2014;there are big, beautiful drawings accompanied by indecipherable letterforms--and&nbsp;it is impossible to &#x201c;read&#x201d; in a literal way. The text has remained a mystery all these years, and perhaps that&#x2019;s part of its draw as an art object.&#x201d; -<i>FineBooks Magazine<br></i><br>&#x201c;Is the best art book of the year one that is not only impossible for me to review, but one that is probably equally impossible for you to understand? It&#x2019;s a handsome, hilarious and enduring puzzle that not only features wonderful art in it, but in its entirety captures another kind of human creativity&#x2014;the encyclopedia, the result of compiling and collecting, and an unlikely medium for artists.&#x201d;<i>&nbsp;-North Adams Transcript</i><br><br>"<i>Codex Seraphinianus</i>: History&#x2019;s Most Bizarre and Beautiful Encyclopedia, Brought Back to Life...a weird and wonderful masterpiece of art and philosophical provocation on the precipice of the information age....Undoubtedly one of the most intricate and beautiful art books ever created." -<i>Brain Pickings</i><br><br>&#x201c;Wow. One of the strangest and most beautiful books ever published.&#x201d;<i> &#x2013;Faerie Tales</i><br><i> &nbsp;</i><br><i> &#x201c;Codex Seraphinianus</i> is in a sense the most elaborate book of doodles ever made. What makes it much more than that is not just the quality of Serafini&#x2019;s drawings and the superior book-making craft, but its brilliant structure. Part of the genius of the <i>Codex</i> is that there is enough information to be familiar but not enough to make any sense.&#x201d;<i> &#x2013;Spectrum Culture</i><br><i> &nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;The intense strangeness of <i>Codex Seraphinianus</i> belies the joyous feel of the artistry. Even the oddest, most unnerving images are rendered with pastel beauty, and a softness that makes them almost endearing.&#x201d;<i> &#x2013;KQED</i></p><h2>Jane Austen</h2><p><p> Devoted fans and scholars of Jane Austen--as well as skeptics--will rejoice at Tony Tanner's superb book on the incomparable novelist. Distilling twenty years of thinking and writing about Austen, Tanner treats in fresh and illuminating ways the questions that have always occupied her most perceptive critics. How can we reconcile the limited social world of her novels with the largeness of her vision? How does she deal with depicting a once-stable society that was changing alarmingly during her lifetime? How does she express and control the sexuality and violence beneath the well-mannered surface of her milieu? How does she resolve the problems of communication among characters pinioned by social reticences? </p><p> Tanner guides us through Austen's novels from relatively sunny early works to the darker, more pessimistic <i>Persuasion</i> and fragmentary <i>Sanditon</i>--a journey that takes her from acceptance of a society maintained by landed property, family, money, and strict propriety through an insistence on the need for authentication of these values to a final skepticism and even rejection. In showing her progress from a parochial optimism to an ability to encompass her whole society, Tanner renews our sense of Jane Austen as one of the great novelists, confirming both her local and abiding relevance. </p></p><p>Tony Tanner's classic text on Jane Austen addresses the issues that have always occupied the author's most perceptive critics, and offers an illuminating and refreshing analysis of Austen's novels. Tanner shows how Austen changed from a basically accepting view of 'society' to a more questioning one and considers the problems of authority, power and the position of women, as well as the relationship between ethics, language and behaviour. <br><br>This reissued edition features a new Preface by leading Romantic scholar Marilyn Gaull who examines Tanner's background and places the original work in context. Lively and informative, the Preface helps to reinforce and explain the continued importance of Tanner's work. Accompanied by an insightful Note on the Text by Austen scholar John Wiltshire, and an expanded Bibliography and Index, this is a timely republication of a study which is now regarded as one of the finest, and most accessible, introductions to a great novelist.<b>Tony Tanner</b> was Professor of English and American Literature, University of Cambridge.</p><h2>Toss the Feathers: Irish Set Dancing</h2><p>This is the most comprehensive paperback ever published on set dancing. It contains sixty-one complete set dances, including all those danced commonly in class, summer schools at feiseanna.

Their aim was to determine how Aboriginal cultural rights in postcolonial societies can be restored and how to find new approaches for protecting, healing, and restoring cultures and languages of long-oppressed peoples.</p><p><p>Indigenous and non-indigenous scholars from North and South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Europe discuss cultural restoration.</p>The essays in Reclaiming Indigenous Voice and Vision spring from an International Summer Institute on the cultural restoration of oppressed Indigenous peoples. The contributors, primarily Indigenous, unravel the processes of colonization that enfolded modern society and resulted in the oppression of Indigenous peoples.<p>The authors -- among them Gregory Cajete, Erica-Irene Daes, Bonnie Duran and Eduardo Duran, James Youngblood Henderson, Linda Hogan, Leroy Little Bear, Ted Moses, Linda Tuhiwai Te Rina Smith, Graham Hingangaroa Smith, and Robert Yazzie -- draw on a range of disciplines, professions, and experiences. Addressing four urgent and necessary issues -- mapping colonialism, diagnosing colonialism, healing colonized Indigenous peoples, and imagining postcolonial visions -- they provide new frameworks for understanding how and why colonization has been so pervasive and tenacious among Indigenous peoples. They also envision what they would desire in a truly postcolonial context.</p><p>In moving and inspiring ways, Reclaiming Indigenous Voice and Vision elaborates a new inclusive vision of a global and national order and articulates new approaches for protecting, healing, and restoring long-oppressed peoples, and for respecting their cultures and languages.</p></p><h2>The Snowman</h2><p>Oslo in November. The first snow of the season has fallen. A boy named Jonas wakes in the night to find his mother gone. Out his window, in the cold moonlight, he sees the snowman that inexplicably appeared in the yard earlier in the day. Around its neck is his mother's pink scarf. <br><br>Hole suspects a link between a menacing letter he's received and the disappearance of Jonas's mother--and of perhaps a dozen other women, all of whom went missing on the day of a first snowfall. As his investigation deepens, something else emerges: he is becoming a pawn in an increasingly terrifying game whose rules are devised--and constantly revised--by the killer.<br><br>Fiercely suspenseful, its characters brilliantly realized, its atmosphere permeated with evil, <i>The Snowman</i> is the electrifying work of one of the best crime writers of our time.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2011</strong>: <em>The Snowman</em>, Norwegian author Jo Nesbï¿½'s thriller, should please even the most die-hard Stieg Larsson fans. On the first day of snow, a child wakes up to find his mother has disappeared during the night. Outside, a snowman has appeared out of nowhere, the calling card of one of the most terrifying serial killers in recent fiction. A letter from the perpetrator draws Detective Hole further and further into the case, and together with his new partner, Katrine Bratt, he hunts the Snowman through twists and turns that become increasingly personal and may drive Hole to the brink of insanity. Brilliantly crafted, this credible and dark page-turner fully fleshes out the characters, especially Hole, a hardened detective with sharp instincts and real heart. What is the link between the victims? Is the Snowman a suspicious doctor, a notorious playboy, or one of Hole's peers on the force? The police keep thinking they've caught the criminal, but Hole's astute observations may steer him around the red herrings and right into the hands of the cold-as-ice killer. <em>--Miriam Landis</em>Jo Nesbï¿½ is a musician, songwriter, economist and author. His first crime novel featuring Harry Hole was published in Norway in 1997 and was an instant hit, winning the Glass Key Award for best Nordic crime novel (an accolade shared with Peter Hï¿½eg, Henning Mankell and Karin Fossum). <b>The Snowman</b> is the fifth of Nesbï¿½'s novels to be translated into English.</p><h2>Christmas In My Heart</h2><p>The year 1991 saw the end of the Cold War.

Collectively these diverse perspectives are united by the notion that if the focus for modernist discussion was individual works of art, it is the exhibition that is the prime cultural carrier of contemporaneity. The texts encompass exhibition design and form; exhibitions that are object-based, live or discursive; projects that no longer rely on a physical space to be visited in person; artists&#39; responses to being curated, and their reflections on the potential of acting curatorially. Set against the rise of the curator as an influential force in the contemporary art world, this volume underlines the crucial role of artists in questioning and shaping the phenomenon of the exhibition.</p><p>Lucy Steeds is an editor of the Exhibition Histories series for Afterall Books and pathway leader in Exhibition Studies at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts, London.&#39;This book is an extensive and fascinating &#39;exhibition&#39; of the exhibition.

Frankl was lauded as one of the most influential thinkers of our time. <i>The Unheard Cry for Meaning</i> marked his return to the humanism that made <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> a bestseller around the world. In these selected essays, written between 1947 and 1977, Dr. Frankl illustrates the vital importance of the human dimension in psychotherapy. Using a wide range of subjects--including sex, morality, modern literature, competitive athletics, and philosophy--he raises a lone voice against the pseudo-humanism that has invaded popular psychology and psychoanalysis. By exploring mankind's remarkable qualities, he brilliantly celebrates each individual's unique potential, while preserving the invaluable traditions of both Freudian analysis and behaviorism.</p><p>VIKTOR E. FRANKL (1905-1997) was an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist as well as a Holocaust survivor.

Her performance captures the emotional upheaval of mortal Bella's desperate love for vampire Edward and the obstacles to their perilous reunion. Like Romeo and Juliet, Edward and Bella suffer from their own folly, as well as the disapproval of their families. Kadushin's silvery, feminine voice delivers the unfolding events with precise, consistent timing, showcasing Meyer's story without overwhelming it.

Much of eastern Cumberland County falls within the boundaries of the Pinelands National Reserve-a 1.1-million-acre tract of mostly forested land. Not a park or refuge where human endeavors are strictly proscribed, the reserve is a jurisdictional hybrid<br>according protection to areas of high environmental or cultural value and permitting compatible development in<br>others. Created by Congress in 1978, operating under a comprehensive management plan, and governed by the representatively diverse Pinelands Commission, both the reserve and the plan are variously acclaimed and decried.<br>&nbsp;People who want to see the environmental and cultural heritage of the region preserved generally applaud it. Large property owners and developers whose ambitions might undermine environmentally sensitive areas commonly fault it.<br>&nbsp;Like it or not, what is certain is that this creative initiative resulted in the protection of 22 percent of the most crowded state in the Union and preserved the largest body of open space between Boston and Richmond. Those shorebound travelers taking old Route 47, as Linda and I had done, are tracing the southern boundary of the preserve.<br>&nbsp;For some reason, the Delaware Bayshore was not placed beneath the umbrella of the reserve's protection. Its heritage and biological riches have, thus far, been preserved largely as a result of good fortune.<br>&nbsp;We passed several turnoffs, marked by weathered signs, directing travelers to communities with names that skirt all but local recognition-names such as Dorchester (pronounced, in the syllable-compressing dialect of the bayshore, DOR-ster), Leesburg, and Heislerville. While few travelers ever do turn off to explore these obscure towns, those who do wander into a New Jersey that is alien to nine out of ten residents of the state.<br>&nbsp;A land of black ducks and blue mud. Tight-knit communities composed of cedar-roofed and dowel-framed houses that hark back to a time when two-masted schooners and two-story homes were built by the same men.<br>&nbsp;Pickup trucks, not cars, occupy most of the driveways. Cats keep watch from behind age-rippled glass, and dogs, slumbering on porches, stir only at the sound of unfamiliar feet. And when you happen, as is certain you will, upon one of the old church cemeteries that command the high ground, you'll find the gate unlocked and age-blackened stones bearing the same names as the mailboxes you just passed.<br>&nbsp;Until recently, saying you lived on the bayshore was as good as saying you were born on the bayshore. This means you have roots that go back very far.<br>&nbsp;Not every road off Route 47 delivers as promised. Travelers bold enough to follow now rusting highway signs to Moores Beach and Thompsons Beach are headed for consternation. In two decades, these bayside communities went from shore towns to ghost towns to no towns as the roads leading out to them surrendered to marsh and the houses fell (literally) under the dominion of the tide.<br>&nbsp;Today, if you own a four-wheel-drive vehicle that you don't mind marinating in salt water, you can still drive to Moores Beach and the rubble-strewn strip of sand that borders the bay and once supported a town. But the road leading out to Thompsons Beach is impassable and gated. Beneath its blanket of salt grass there is macadam. At low tide it is navigable to foot traffic (or, more accurately, knee-high-boot traffic). But under the very best of conditions, the road that once led to this fishing community is treacherous. A person (or persons) would have to be very foolish, or very motivated, to attempt it.<br>Blue Mud<br>&#x201c;Eahhh!&#x201d; Linda cried, the sound of her protest barely audible over the cries of laughing gulls and the belly-laugh grunts of clapper rails-both of which are common summer residents.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked, turning, looking back at my wife, who was swaying, ominously, at a better than twenty-three-degree list, in the middle of a puddle that was the size and depth of a kiddie pool, though a good deal muddier.<br>&nbsp;Why ominously? Because the pack on her back was crammed with about twenty thousand dollars' worth of camera equipment and, as the Nikon owner's manual cautions, digital cameras and salt water don't mix.<br>&nbsp;Linda's no stranger to portaging stuff on her back. A onetime National Outdoor Leadership School instructor, she once climbed Denali wearing a hundred-pound pack-a pack that weighed as much as she did. Concluding, therefore, that ballast was not the source of my wife's consternation, I explored the possibility of an equipment malfunction.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Boots leak?&#x201d; I asked, when her gyrations had stabilized enough to support conversation.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;No!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;They're too large. The muck keeps sucking them off my fee--Ehh; ahhhh.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;I tensed as Linda survived another arm-swinging battle with gravity. Search the world over, you'll find hardly anything more slick, slimy, and boot-suckingly treacherous than good ol' Delaware Bay blue mud. The fine particulate matter, ferried and deposited by the waters of the Delaware River, has the color and consistency of graphite and the sulfurous smell of hell. Dark spatterings of the stuff were already marring Linda's pretty face. But since she wasn't going to be on the receiving side of the cameras she was carrying, it hardly mattered.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;We're almost there,&#x201d; I encouraged. &#x201c;The road's better ahead.&#x201d; This was true as far as it went. What I didn't say, which was also true, was &#x201c;and then it gets worse again.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Ten minutes later, our boots, still numbering four, were planted on packed white sand. In front of us was a sun-splashed Delaware Bay. Around us the rubble that used to be Thompsons Beach.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;There are no birds,&#x201d; Linda couldn't help noticing.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, there were,&#x201d; I asserted.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;When?&#x201d; she wanted to know.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;About twenty years ago,&#x201d; I said, smiling quickly to let her know it was a joke.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;This way,&#x201d; I said, turning east. &#x201c;Another quarter mile. I scouted it yesterday. An hour earlier. The tide should be about the same, and there absolutely were birds.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Including knots?&#x201d; she asked, pinning a name to the poster bird of Delaware Bay's famed spring shorebird concentrations.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Including knots,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Some. Ready to go?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;She was, and we did. Walked east along the narrow strip of sand and through the remains of the town. But I couldn't help thinking of the way it had been twenty years ago - both with the town and with the birds. And how the diminishment of what was one of the planet's greatest natural spectacles was anything but a joke.<br>Crabs and Shorebirds for Lunch<br>My introduction to the now-famous spectacle of spawning crabs and migrating shorebirds came in May 1977. I was responding to an invitation by Jim and Joan Seibert, residents of the bayside hamlet of Del Haven-a cluster of houses clinging to the land about halfway up the Cape May peninsula.<br>&nbsp;They said that the beach in front of their house was awash in birds.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Fantastic,&#x201d; they assessed. &#x201c;Unbelievable,&#x201d; they promised. &#x201c;Come to lunch.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;I did. And while, as the newly minted naturalist for the incipient Cape May Bird Observatory, I would have come just to see the birds, the promise of a free lunch was irresistible.<br>&nbsp;Naturalists the world over are opportunistic feeders. Since my position with the New Jersey Audubon Society was earning me a whopping $250 a month, such flexible feeding habits had clear survival advantages. In this regard, naturalists are much like the shorebirds that concentrate here in spring. They, too, are in it for the eats.<br>&nbsp;Lunch was enjoyable, the birds as advertised. Fantastic, unbelievable. A pulsing, vibrating ribbon of shorebirds stretching as far as the eye could see - tiny gray-backed semipalmated sandpipers, sanderlings in their rarely seen brick red breeding plumage, harlequin-patterned ruddy turnstones, and, best of all, red knots! Big, burly, silver-backed shorebirds and high-Arctic breeders. There were more knots on that single stretch of beach than I'd ever dreamed of. More knots, as it turned out, than were estimated to be in all of North America.<br>&nbsp;But just as impressive, perhaps more, was the concentration of breeding horseshoe crabs, whose tiny gray-green eggs were the foundation and objective of the feeding birds-the tiny loaves that fed the multitudes.<br>&nbsp;Hubcap-sized, bronze-colored, and helmet-shaped, the 340-million-year-old sea creatures absolutely carpeted the beach. There were hundreds of larger female crabs, half buried in sand, and thousands of attending males.<br>&nbsp;To the crabs, it was all about sex. To the birds, it was all about gluttony.<br>&nbsp;Many years later, I would read an account of the spawning crabs written by Alexander Wilson, the father of American ornithology. Writing in the early 1800s of the stretch of beach east of the mouth of the Maurice River-the stretch of beach Linda and I were walking now-Wilson noted that a person could walk ten miles upon the carapaces of horseshoe crabs and never touch the sand.<br>&nbsp;It was this way, too, in 1977 and for about a decade after, and my experience here is firsthand.<br>&nbsp;Starting in 1981, I was part of a three-person team fly_ing aerial surveys to gauge the magnitude of the shorebird concentrations along New Jersey's bayshore. We counted a peak one-day total of 350,000 birds during those inaugural survey flights, including 67,000 red knots. The following year, adding the cross-bay beaches of the state of Delaware to the survey route, our totals reached 420,000 birds, including 95,000 red knots.<br>&nbsp;Given a turnover of fourteen days, biologists projected that a total of a million to perhaps a million and a half shorebirds were foraging on bayshore beaches between May 10 and June 10, making the spectacle on Delaware Bay one of the greatest concentrations of shorebirds on the planet. From there, fully fueled on the fat of reconstituted crab eggs, the birds would fly nonstop to Arctic breeding grounds and arrive in fine shape to go about the serious business of replicating the species.<br>&nbsp;The crabs were estimated to number 10 to 20 million, by far the greatest aggregation of this living fossil known to science. On every high tide, when the crabs would emerge, the shells in the surf sounded like crockery rattling in some great sink. As the tide receded, it looked as though the beaches were paved in animate cobblestones.<br>&nbsp;That was the celebrated phenomenon. An annual massed gathering of living things on the narrow beaches of Delaware Bay. Nobody knows how long it had been going on. But everybody knows how long it lasted after it was rediscovered. About fifteen years.</p> <p>Knot Now<br>Past the pilings that once supported the homes and docks of Thompsons Beach, and the rubble that is all that is left of them, there is a quarter mile of open beach. The tide was still rising. Here and there along the old high-tide line were shallow craters that marked the location of newly deposited horseshoe crab eggs. Every ten yards or so, Linda and I encountered an overturned crab-mostly male. We righted these with our boots, to the annoyance of the onlooking host of herring gulls, who enjoy scavenging rights to all dead and dying crabs.<br>&nbsp;The winds, light and northerly, were projected to go slack, then southerly by afternoon. Good news for crabs and birds primed to migrate. Not so good for writers and photographers, who would have to contend with the clouds of biting midges called &#x201c;no-see-ums.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Almost there,&#x201d; I said once again to Linda, who was overturning crabs, so lagging behind. Near the mouth of the creek, projecting out into the bay, was a sod bank that the birds had been using at low tide. Birds were still there: a couple of dozen turnstones, and a handful of knots. It wasn't the throngs of birds we'd been hoping for, but at least the trip wouldn't be a total bust.<br>&nbsp;I reached the end of the beach. Edged myself around a tall stand of reed grass, and . . .<br>&nbsp;There, clustered about the sandy bar, were about a thousand shorebirds, all busily foraging for eggs. Lots of semipalmated sandpipers, lots of sanderlings, lots of ruddy turnstones, and best of all, lots of red knots-not the 6,000 that were reported to be up in the bay (about one third of the current estimated populations). But six hundred at least-most of them decked out in their breeding plumage, the silver backs and ruddy breasts that were the source of the old market gunners' name for the bird, &#x201c;robin snipe.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Linda turned the corner. Stared. Smiled. Here, on a spit of sand some forty feet wide and two hundred feet long, was a concentration of birds that harked back to the wonder and bounty that greeted visitors when shorebird numbers were at their peak.<br>&nbsp;Linda slipped out of her pack. Cracked the cover. Starting fitting lenses to cameras.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I'll open the tripod,&#x201d; I offered.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Are you going to stand or kneel?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Kneel,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Crawl. I want to be eye level with these birds. I want to taste horseshoe crab eggs. Do you want to shoot?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You might have to dig,&#x201d; I said, suddenly conscious of the fact that the birds were not foraging on exposed eggs. All of them seemed to be probing and rooting. It was an adaptation I'd never seen. Back in the days of plenty, only the turnstones were egg mass excavators. Now, it seemed, all the successful birds were doing it.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I'll leave you the two-hundred-to-four-hundred lens,&#x201d; Linda said, not waiting for my reply. &#x201c;It's set for program, and you've got a new memory card.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;This is so awesome,&#x201d; she said, lifting her camera fitted with her favorite 500-millimeter lens (named &#x201c;Big Bertha&#x201d;). &#x201c;This is so cool,&#x201d; she assessed. Then she waded slowly into the birds, whose ranks parted to receive her. In less than five minutes, Linda was seated in the sand and surrounded by birds. A 50-millimeter lens would have served her better.<br>&nbsp;It was awesome. It was affirming. In fact, it was perfect.<br>&nbsp;Almost perfect.<br>Undoing the Knot<br>I didn't start shooting immediately. And I didn't take notes, which, being the scribe in this endeavor, I should have been doing. What I did instead was savor. The spectacle. The day. The miracle that is a shorebird. The study in pure, applied hard-shelled tenacity that is a horseshoe crab.<br>&nbsp;The red knot, owing to the rapid and dramatic decline in its numbers, has been studied and written about extensively. In less than two decades' time, the population of the rufa subspecies, the subspecies whose strategy for survival seems tied to Delaware Bay, went from an estimated high of 160,000 to about 18,000. In cold, clinical mathematics, its population is now just over a tenth of what it was when I first set eyes on the spectacle, over thirty years ago.<br>&nbsp;The undoing of the phenomenon was unnecessary and preventable.

Born in New York City, Hjortsberg&#x2019;s first success came with <i>Alp</i> (1969), an offbeat story of an Alpine skiing village, which Hjortsberg&#x2019;s friend Thomas McGuane called, &#x201c;quite possibly the finest comic novel written in America.&#x201d; In the 1970s, Hjortsberg wrote two science fiction novels, <i>Gray Matters </i>(1971) and <i>Symbiography</i> (1973), as well as <i>Toro! Toro! Toro!</i> (1974), a comic jab at the macho world of bullfighting. His best-known work is <i>Falling Angel</i> (1978), a hard-boiled occult mystery. In 1987 the book was adapted into a film titled <i>Angel Heart</i>, which starred Robert De Niro and Mickey Rourke.

The novel was a finalist for the National Book Award and was praised by writers as "a triumph of storytelling and inspired historical analysis" (Robert Stone) and by reviewers as "one of the year's most substantial literary accomplishments" (<i>The New Yorker</i>). <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with <i>Master of the Crossroads</i>, Bell achieves an even greater accomplishment: he brings to life the rise to power of the great Haitian military general Toussaint Louverture and the story of the only successful slave revolution in history.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in 1794, Toussaint led his troops to victory over English and Spanish invaders, over the French political establishment, and in a civil uprising for control of the infant island republic. He extended the ideological triumph of the French and American revolutions by offering universal liberty and human rights to all races.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In chronicling Toussaint's victory and its aftermath, Bell gives us a kaleidoscopic portrait of this extraordinary figure as seen through the eyes of the men and women whose paths he crossed. English, French, Spanish, and African--the intersection of peoples who inhabited this war-torn island creates a rich social canvas against which the astonishing story of Toussaint Louverture--his beliefs, passions, and compulsions--unfolds over the course of nine tumultuous years.</p><p>In 1995 Madison Smartt Bell published <i>All Souls' Rising</i>, earning both critical plaudits and a National Book Award nomination for this fictional account of Haiti's 18th-century slave rebellion. Now he continues the saga with <i>Master of the Crossroads</i>, the second volume of a projected trilogy. Even in his earlier narratives of contemporary America, the author has always been attuned to the byzantine politics of color. But by focusing on the figure of Toussaint Louverture--the black general who led the Haitians to independence only to be jailed for treason against the French Republic--Bell allows the politics of race to point him in unexpected and rewarding narrative directions. This is a big, muscular book, which derives much of its strength from the author's willingness to paint his tumultuous political and physical landscapes with broadly sweeping strokes. But it is also a work of surprising delicacy, whose finely drawn characters come to life with the minutest gesture or softly whispered word.<p> The crossroads herein are not merely literal but metaphorical. Yes, the former slaves and their courageous leader are pinned down in the island's remote interior, caught between the English forces and the Spanish army (their nominal yet treacherous ally). But more to the point, Haiti's intricate progress from slavery to freedom brings each of the characters to a crucial, defining moment of energy or introspection. And finally, swirling through the book like an island mist, is the voodoo figure of Mï¿½it' Kalfou, or the "Master of the Crossroads." Straddling the worlds of the dead and the living, this ecstatic spirit may at any time inhabit the body of a believer: </p><blockquote> Between Legba and Kalfou the crossroads stood open now, and now Guiaou could feel that opened pathway rushing up his spine--passage from the Island Below Sea inhabited by <i>les Morts et les Mystï¿½res</i>. His hips melted into the movement of the drums, and the tails of the red coat swirled around his legs like feathers of a bird. With the other dancers he closed the small, tight circle around Legba and Kalfou, who faced each other as in a mirror: the shining surface of the waters, which divides the living from the dead. </blockquote> Throughout, Bell's captivating vision of the battlefield bears witness to his rigorous research. Still, the voodoo celebrations, and the author's sly evocation of their unexpected resonance, remain the novel's strongest moments. Why? They speak, perhaps, to the apocalyptic nature of the Haitian rebellion. And more intriguingly, they permit Bell to play with the deceptive nature of belief and reality--a move that, in an avowedly historical novel, hints at the ironic fluidity of history itself. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i>Madison Smartt Bell is the author of eleven previous works of&nbsp;&nbsp;fiction, including <i>All Souls' Rising</i>, which was a National Book Award finalist; <i>Save Me, Joe Louis; Dr. Sleep; Soldier's Joy;</i> and <i>Ten Indians.</i> He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><h2>The Moths of North America, Fascicle 22.1A.

In Emma Enters a Sentence of Elizabeth Bishop's,&#x201d; a young woman growing up in rural Iowa finds herself losing touch with the physical world as she loses herself in the work of her favorite poet. And in The Master of Secret Revenges,&#x201d; God appears in the form of a demon to a young man named Luther, whose progress from devilish youth to satanic manhood is recounted with relish and horror.A profound exploration of good and evil, philosophy and action, marked by the wit and style that has always defined the work of William Gass.</p><p>Reading William H. Gass's fiction is a little like looking at oneself in a fractured mirror: the usual components are all there, but not necessarily in the right places. Take, for example, the title novella of <i>Cartesian Sonata and Other Novellas</i>: here Gass introduces us to Ella Bend, a sensitive clairvoyant married to a rather burdensome husband. But no sooner does Gass get us started with a very conventional opening, ("This is the story of Ella Bend Hess, of how she became clairvoyant and what she was able to see") than he injects himself into it ("Her gift was the gift of the gods ... inexplicable and merciless. Marvelous is what I mean. Miraculous. Mysterious? Surely not a word so weak. Yet it has to begin with an <i>m</i>"). It isn't long before Ella becomes a bit player in her own story, the starring role having been appropriated by artful digressions, dizzying streams of consciousness, and Gass's own formidable wordsmithing talents.<p> The other three novellas in this collection are equally high-concept: a traveling salesman falls in love with his hotel room and refuses to leave; an aging spinster literally loses herself in a line from an Elizabeth Bishop poem; a young boy inexplicably decides to live for revenge. The plots, such as they are, are offbeat enough to catch the interest--what holds it, however, is Gass at play in the fields of the word. <i>Cartesian Sonata</i> will not be to every reader's taste--those who are impatient with absurdity, non sequiturs, and pages and pages of verbal pyrotechnics may want to steer toward more conventional literature. Those who like their fiction liberally laced with equal measures of philosophy and anarchy, however, should give William H. Gass a try.</p>rd-winning author of The Tunnel and Finding a Form--four interrelated novellas that explore Mind, Matter, and God. In the first novella, Gass redefines Descartes&#39; philosophy. God is a writer in a constant state of fumble. Mind is represented by a housewife who is a modern-day Cassandra. And Matter is, what (and who) else but the helpless and confused husband of Mind. In the novella that follows, the concept of salvation is explored through material possessions--a collection of kitsch--as a traveling businessman is slowly lost in the sheer surfeit of matter in a small Illinois town. In another, Gass explores the mind&#39;s ability to escape. A young woman growing up in ruralIowa finds herself losing touch with the physical world as she loses herself in the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop. And in &#34;The Master of Secret Revenges,&#34; God appears in the form of Descartes&#39; evil demon, Lucifer, as Gass chronicles the life of a young man named Luther and his development from his devilish youth to his demonic ad</p><h2>Caring like Jesus: The Matthew 18 Project</h2><p>What would it mean if we were to live out the teachings of Jesus as found in Matthew 18?

The book encompasses most of Winogrand&#x2019;s themes and subjects and remains broadly faithful to the chronological and geographical facts of his life, but Dyer&#x2019;s responses to the photographs are unorthodox, eye-opening, and often hilarious. This inimitable combination of photographer and writer, images and text, itself offers what Dyer claims for Winogrand&#x2019;s photography&#x2014;an education in seeing.</p></p><p>Geoff Dyer&#x2019;s many books include The Ongoing Moment (winner of the International Center of Photography&#x2019;s prestigious Infinity Award for Writing/Criticism), But Beautiful (winner of the Somerset Maugham Prize), Out of Sheer Rage (shortlisted for a National Book Critics Circle Award), The Missing of the Somme, the novel Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi, and the essay collection Otherwise Known as the Human Condition (winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award). His latest book is White Sands: Experiences from the Outside World. A recipient of a Lannan Literary Fellowship, the E. M. Forster Prize and, most recently, the Windham-Campbell Prize for nonfiction, Dyer is an honorary fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford; a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature; and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His books have been translated into twenty-four languages. Dyer is currently writer-in-residence at the University of Southern California."Dyer has cracked open a window on Winogrand that&#x2019;s always been there but never been opened." (Jeffrey Fraenkel, Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco)<br><br>"Geoff Dyer is so open to every aspect of art that when he turns his eyes and heart to the photography of Garry Winogrand we get the full benefit of his education, his insight, and the transparency of his prose, and we cherish the fact that his voice lives in our head for a moment to intensify and elucidate&#x2014;but never explain&#x2014;why these images mean so much." (Matthew Weiner, creator of Mad Men)<br><br>"Geoff Dyer has created a kind of Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering Winogrand . . . how Winogrand becomes Winogrand. This book is a revelatory pleasure from beginning to end, a lesson in the pleasure of seeing. It is a smart book, but it&#x2019;s a wise book, too." (Alex Harris, Duke University, coeditor of Arrivals and Departures: The Airport Photographs of Garry Winogrand)<br><br>"This handsome collection amounts to an extensive tour of Winogrand&#x2019;s photographs conducted by a savvy, observant, and highly entertaining guide.

Blending poetic sensibility with painstaking research, this New York Times bestseller charts the relationship between writer and boat through three marriages, the Nobel Prize, and all his triumph and tragedy; how he sailed the waters from Key West to Cuba, and hunted big-game fish and German U-boats; and how, in 1961, the yacht finally slipped away from him, along with life itself.</p><p>Paul Hendrickson is the prize-winning author of Seminary; Looking for the Light; The Living and the Dead and Sons of Mississippi. He currently teaches non-fiction writing at the University of Pennsylvania and for two decades before that he was a staff writer at the Washington Post.AMERICAN LIGHT<br><br>APRIL 3, 1934. The temperature in Manhattan got into the high sixties. G-men shot an accomplice of Dillinger's in Minnesota; the Nazis were running guns to the Moors; Seminoles were reviving a tribal dance in honor of alligators in Florida; Lou Gehrig had two homers in an exhibition game in Atlanta. And roughly the bottom third of America was out of work.<br><br>According to "Steamship Movements in New York," a column that runs daily in the business section of the <i>Evening Journal</i>, nine liners are to dock today. The SS <i>Paris</i>, 34,500 tons, is just sliding in after a seven-day Atlantic crossing, from Le Havre via Plymouth, at Pier 57 on the West Side of New York City.<br><br>"Expected to dock: 5:00 P.M.," reports the newspaper. And she does.<br><br>If this were a Movietone News item about Hemingway the big-game hunter, arriving home after eight months abroad, and you were in a darkened movie palace of the thirties awaiting the feature, you'd see ropes being thrown off, gangplanks being lowered, steamer trunks being unloaded, and passengers starting gaily to stream off. You'd see the New York press boys with their rumpled suits and stained ties and skinny notebooks and Speed Graphic cameras clawing for position. The blocky white lettering superimposed on the flickering images would announce: "Back from Lion Hunt in East Africa!" They'd bring up the sound track-something stirring, to suggest the march of time. And then would come the voice-over&#x2014;wouldn't it be Ed Herlihy's?&#x2014;with its electric charge: "Famed author Mr. Ernest Hemingway, just back on the French liner<i> Paris</i> with Mrs. Hemingway from conquering the lion and the rhino and the wildebeest and the greater kudu, says that death in the afternoon is far less engrossing in a Spanish bull ring than on the African veldt."<br><br>The press boys clotted at the bottom of the gangplank badly want Hemingway, and they want Katharine Hepburn (she is on the boat, too, and makes wonderful copy, when she deigns to speak), but apparently none of them knows (for none of their papers will have it tomorrow) that an even bigger trophy has just berthed at Pier 57: Marlene Dietrich. She's going to give them the nifty slip. Publicity? Who needs it? Maybe Dietrich's hiding out in her stateroom. She might have registered under a different name-glamorous figures routinely do this. In fact, Hepburn is on the manifest as "Miss Katherine Ludlow." (Her husband is Ludlow Ogden Smith.) <i>She</i> has decided not to hide from the pack.<br><br>The famous and close and long-lasting Dietrich-Hemingway friendship dates from this Atlantic crossing. For the rest of his life, Hemingway mostly called her the Kraut, when he wasn't addressing her as "daughter," the latter being how he liked to address women younger than himself, famous or otherwise, whom he'd not&#x2014;apparently&#x2014;taken to bed. Dietrich was two and a half years younger. There is a well-traveled story about how she was stepping into the ship's dining room to join a dinner party. Every open-jawed man at the table rose to give her his chair, but just as she started to sit down, the international flame with the statuesque body and lusty voice counted the mouths and saw that there were twelve diners. "Oh. I'm the thirteenth. You will excuse me if I don't join you. I'm superstitious about thirteen at dinner," she said, starting to withdraw. But just then Hemingway blocked her way. "Excuse me," he said. "I don't mean to intrude. But I'd be glad to be the fourteenth."<br><br>Afterward, they supposedly strolled the decks arm in arm and told each other-maybe like Bogart and Claude Rains in <i>Casablanca</i>, except that that movie hadn't been made yet-that this was going to be the start of a beautiful friendship. At least this is the legend, and Dietrich herself greatly helped it along in 1955 in a first-person cover story in the Sunday supplement of the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>. The piece was titled "The Most Fascinating Man I Know." She talked of how she and Hemingway had depended on each other through the years, how she'd protected his deeply personal letters to her in a strongbox. Actually, Dietrich may not have even written the piece&#x2014;according to Mary Hemingway, it was ghosted by journalist and scriptwriter A. E. Hotchner, one of Hemingway's last confidants, or toadies, depending on your point of view, for the two-decades-younger Hotch, as Hemingway often called him, has been described as both in the vast, roily, envy-ridden sea of Hemingway studies. In any case, among smaller errors, Dietrich or her ghost got the name of the boat wrong; she said it was the other (even grander) star of the French line, the <i>ï¿½le de France</i>.<br><br>But this is a newsreel of the imagination. Hemingway's poised at the <i>Paris</i>'s rail with his spouse. He's intent on purchasing a boat, but right now he's allowing photographs to be made, and he's popping quotes. Freeze the frame. Stop time in a box.<br><br>Pauline Hemingway is in a zebra-striped suit and an almost dowdy hat, curled at the brim, tilting right to left. Her right shoulder touches her husband's left. She is so small beside him. Her hair is cropped like a boy's. She has a boyish physique and is known for her disinclination to use makeup. (It's true she likes to keep her nails and toes manicured for her husband, often lacquering them in light pink.) Her body is turned a few degrees away from the rail, as if she might decide to walk off any second now. She's probably not getting a word in edgewise. She isn't a beautiful woman, but she isn't unattractive, either. She is four years and a day older than her husband, who is leaning forward, right into the middle of things, as if right into the middle of reporters' notebooks. Both his arms are on the rail, and his right hand is holding the brim of a fedora that has a wide, dark band. He's wearing a suit and tie and there's a sliver of handkerchief visible at the top of his vest pocket. No matter his dress, he's unmistakably a man of the outdoors, with the body of an athlete. His hair looks Brylcreemed and newly cut, although a strand or two at the back of his head are out of place. Around his seventeen-and-a-half-inch neck, inside his dress shirt, is a scapular: he's a convert to Catholicism, which is his wife's devoutly practiced faith. (She's a "cradle Catholic," while his on-again, off-again devotions are reputed to have arisen out of the shocks of World War I.) He's known to wear his scapular unfailingly in these years. It's got an image of Christ on it, suspended from a brown, shoestring-like loop. At home, in Key West, friends have observed him with the scapular, and how he'll make the sign of the cross before he goes in swimming.<br><br>That smile: hobnailed and hard-boiled all the way, just this side of aggressive. The more you study the photograph, however, the more you see that both Hemingways are holding a pose.<br><br>This picture, or versions of it, is going to get picked up and run in many hinterland places, including in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, where winter still has the earth in her grip, and where a young, self-styled, Hemingway-like character will see the photograph and tear it out of the <i>Pioneer Press</i> and fold it into his pocket and pack his knapsack and hop a freight to Florida, in hopes of meeting his writing idol. The young man's name is Arnold Morse Samuelson, and he is in for the ride of his life. But that's running out ahead.<br><br>Not every city editor in New York&#x2014;there are something like nine dailies in the city in 1934&#x2014;has sent a reporter to the docks today to shag quotes and to compose deathless passages on deadline about the return of the native. (In the old days of the news business, these pieces were often known as "brights." <i>Go get me a Hemingway bright</i>, some pale, overweight editor at the <i>Times</i> surely growled at a reporter on the city desk.) And what is the "fascinating man" saying to the press boys? He's telling them how he gives first honors to the leopards, "because they strike the fastest." But the lion is such a noble beast, too, he says. "He is not afraid or stupid. He does not want to fight, but sometimes man makes him, and then it is up to the man to shoot his way out of what he has got himself into." With the lion and the leopard, "you're either quick or you're dead. I saw a lion do one hundred yards in three seconds flat, which may give you an idea." The hunter saw ninety-six lions altogether and at one point he photographed twenty-nine lionesses "preening themselves like a group of finishing school girls." He made a moral bargain with himself to bring down only animals that were utter strangers to him; the lions that he'd stalked with his camera he could somehow not force himself to shoot. But now he intends to return to his home in Key West and resume his vocation. His season of intense writing, he hints, may or may not concern Africa.<br><br>The <i>World-Telegram</i> will have a seven-grapher tomorrow, page 11 ("Jungle Praised by Hemingway"). The lead:<br><br>Ernest Hemingway, author . . . is back home and "nearly broke" after eight months abroad, three of which he spent on the "dark continent." The trouble with bull-fighting, in the opinion of the man who admits he knows so little about it that he wrote a book on the subject, is simply that it's too formal. Like all invitation affairs, he holds, it has a plethora of rules. Out in the brush where the hunter fights for a clawhold with his prey as man to beast-and no rules committee in the offing-it's more fun.<br><br>The <i>Herald Tribune</i>'s subhead on its Hemingway bright (eleven paragraphs, page 4): "Author, Back from African Hunt, Says He Never Shot Beasts Trailed for Camera." The lead: "Ernest Hemingway, enthusiastic over the three months he had passed in East Africa stalking big game with rifle and camera, returned yesterday on the French liner Paris with Mrs. Hemingway, who shared his adventures. Mr. Hemingway was in such high spirits that he granted an interview, something unusual for him."<br><br>The subject's first quote: "It's hard to describe just what there is to killing big game. It's very exciting and-uh-it gives you a fine feeling. It's the sort of the same thing as any killing; that is, it's fine, if you do a clean job of it and it's lousy if there's bad sportsmanship." Toward the end: "The pursuit of game having renewed his enthusiasm for life, he returned home 'to work like hell and make enough money so that I can go back to Africa and really learn something about lions.' "<br><br>It must be the <i>Herald Trib</i>'s account that E. B. White of <i>The New Yorker</i> catches on his way to work on the morning of the fourth. The Herald Trib is the highbrow newspaper of choice in Manhattan, and these quotes are apparently just too much for a domesticated literary man. Because the following week, a three-stanza Hemingway send-up titled "The Law of the Jungle" appears on page 31 of <i>The New Yorker</i>. White's final lines:<br><br>And who, in time of darkest danger<br><br>Will only dominate a stranger.<br><br>Seventeen years from now, on the publication of Hemingway's weakest novel, <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>, White, great American humorist, never a white hunter on the dark continent, will bring down Hemingway again in the magazine with a parody titled "Across the Street and into the Grill." By then parodying Hemingway will have become a cottage sport and pastime in America. White's piece will particularly enrage the author, perhaps because he instantly understands that it will get into anthologies and live way past his own death.<br><br>What was Ernest Hemingway's interior state when he stood at the Paris rail with his petite and affluent spouse on the eve of acquiring <i>Pilar</i>? (Pauline's uncle, Gus Pfeiffer&#x2014;a New York businessman, part of whose fortune had been derived from his interests in a Paris and Manhattan perfumer named Richard Hudnut, and who liked Ernest a good deal, at least then-had staked the safari somewhere to the bottom line of about $30,000. The safari had lasted just a little over two months, not three, as was reported. Hemingway had been in Africa for nearly three months, but not in the bush for that long, and for about a week of the actual safari he was confined to a hospital bed in Nairobi, having suffered an attack of amoebic dysentery that necessitated evacuation by light plane.)<br><br>A whole lot of his state of mind can be glimpsed in his writing, not least his letter writing. Hemingway wrote somewhere between six and seven thousand letters in his life, by hand and by typewriter and by dictation, usually in free-associative bursts, often after a day's writing, to relieve tension, more or less in the way you'd speak in a conversation. This is particularly true of his letters to friends and to certain family members. "The desire to get to the man behind the work can be sometimes overwhelming. I always go back to the letters," Patrick Hemingway told me in 1987, a sentence that seems only truer with time.<br><br>Hemingway's momentary high spirits in early April 1934 must have had at least two prongs: he was back from his excellent safari adventure; and now, before heading home by train to Florida, he hoped to go to a Brooklyn boatyard and put in an order for his own longed-for fishing machine. And yet, what his letters, cojoined with verifiable facts of his life just then, suggest is that what might have seemed so clear in a photograph and in what he told some shipside reporters didn't nearly reflect what Hemingway was generally feeling inside. Every good photograph has a secret, a critic named Mark Stevens once wrote: "Something mysteriously and tantalizingly withheld, even when the world seems laid out as plainly as a corpse upon a table."<br><br>One verifiable truth is that the monarch of American letters had been riding through rough critical seas for the last few years&#x2014;and much more rough going was up ahead. Somehow, nothing seemed quite as locked as it once did, and that included owning the reviewers. Not quite a year earlier&#x2014;on June 13, 1933&#x2014;the author for whom things had once seemed to come so effortlessly had written to his book editor: "I am tempted never to publish another damned thing. The swine arent worth writing for. I swear to Christ they're not. Every phase of the whole racket is so disgusting that it makes you feel like vomiting. . . . And it is a commonplace that I lack confidence that I am a man&#x2014;What shit&#x2014;And I'm supposed to go around with your good friends spreading that behind my back-And they imagine they will get away with it." He'd been referring specifically in this instance to his former friend Max Eastman (a fellow Scribners author), who'd just written a half-joking and belated review of <i>Death in the Afternoon</i> for <i>The New Republic</i> titled "Bull in the Afternoon." The Hemingway style, Eastman said, was that "of wearing false hair on the chest." In Hemingway's reading, and in the reading of some of his close friends, the piece wasn't trying to be humorous at all but rather was making overt suggestions to the effect that Hemingway must feel sexually inadequate. Well, he'd break Eastman's jaw the next time he saw him, and sell tickets to the event.<br><br>One way to read Ernest Hemingway's life is through the phenomenon of remarkable first luck. He'd become an international literary figure, specifically as a novelist, so quickly&#x2014;in the second half of the 1920s, less than a decade from when he'd started out. He'd started out with stories&#x2014;actually, sometimes just intensely felt imagistic fragments of stories.</p><h2>American Heritage DICTIONARY of the English Langauge NEW COLLEGE Edition PLAIN EDGE</h2><p>Contains over 155,000 entries, with current meanings given first.

It&#x2019;s fresh and new, decidedly humorous, and even relatively easy to draw. With this fun collection, bestselling author Chris Hart gives kids a chance to create their own. These cool stories feature ordinary teens thrust into thrilling situations&#x2014;teens with dual identities, who live as regular students by day and become secret spies on weekends. The art straddles the line between comic book and cartoony; offers strong male and female heroes; and showcases a colorful cast of sinister villains and entertaining sidekicks. These exuberant characters will encourage readers to replicate every drawing in the book&#x2014;as will Chris&#x2019;s trademark friendly, personal, and thorough coverage of art principles. <br></p><p>Grade 4 Up&#x2014;This fun guide works best for those with some previous figure-drawing experience (or as a source of entertainment for fans of the style). Sections on "Drawing the Head," "Drawing the Teen Action Body," and "Using Body Language to Convey Emotion" offer detailed and, for the most part, step-by-step instructions. Subsequent sections are less detailed, but provide examples of unique and zany aspects of adventure-style characters. In fact, what makes the book so entertaining is the thin line between technique and flourish. From the beginning, Hart includes written side comments with the most basic of instructions. For example, in his instruction for drawing the head of a teen boy hero, he notes, "Heroes DO NOT have skinny necks." For the teen girl hero, he writes, "An overbite is an attractive look for characters with full lips." Throughout the book, Hart also includes useful tip boxes, often demonstrating how not to draw a character. These suggestions are invaluable, providing insight into creating kinetic and expressive cartoons. Even if readers walk away without having mastered new adventure cartoon illustration, they will at least gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the style.&#x2014;<i>Kim T.

In this authoritative and wholly engrossing history, distinguished scholar Tommaso Astarita &#x201c;does a masterful job of correcting this error&#x201d; (Mark Knoblauch, <em>Booklist</em>). From the Normans and Angevins, through Spanish and Bourbon rule, to the unification of Italy in 1860, Astarita rescues the South from the dustier folds of history and restores it to sparkling life. We are introduced to the freethinking, cosmopolitan King Frederick, who conferred with Jewish and Muslim philosophers; to Masaniello, &#x201c;the fisherman of Naples,&#x201d; who inspired artists and revolutionaries across Europe; and to the colorful religious observances, diverse population, ancient ruins, beautiful landscapes, sweet music, and magnificent art&#x2015;all of which inspired visitors to claim that one had to &#x201c;see Naples, and then die.&#x201d;<br></p><p>Tommaso Astarita is a professor of history at Georgetown University. He is a native Neapolitan and currently lives in Washington, DC.The history of Italy tends to focus on events from Rome northward, too often giving short shift to the peculiarly named "Kingdom of the Two Sicilies." Astarita does a masterful job of correcting this error and bringing to life for English speakers the people and events of these lands so central to the entire Mediterranean basin. European by geography, the region had close ties to Africa from the time of Carthage onward. Post-Roman Empire southern Italy fell under the sway of the Normans in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and Astarita recounts the era of kings Roger I and II, who dealt with the diverse powers of the papacy and sizable Muslim populations in their realm. Astarita is at his best discussing South Italy and Sicily's social history, the roles of religion and superstition as animating forces in the populace's everyday lives. A highly readable history, this volume will be enthusiastically received wherever there are concentrations of Italian-Americans. Population tables and genealogical charts add to the text's clarity. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

He then says, "Borgia references aside, 21st-century American readers of <i>The Prince</i> may feel that they have stumbled on a thinly disguised Bush White House political memo." These pointed words would sting regardless of who uttered them, but coming from Phillips, a former Republican strategist, they have an added piquancy. In <i>American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush</i>, Phillips traces the rise of the Bush family from investment banking elites to political power brokers, using their Ivy League network, vast wealth, and questionable political maneuvering to obtain the White House and consequently, shake the foundation of constitutional American democracy. Citing the Bush family mainstays of finance, energy (oil), the military industrial complex, and national security and intelligence (the CIA), Phillips uses copious examples to show the dangerous alliance between the Bushes' business interests (huge corporations such as Enron and Haliburton) and the formation of national policy. No other family, Phillips says, that has fulfilled its presidential aspirations has been so involved in the ascendancy of the arms industry and of the 21st-century American imperium--often at the expense of regional and world peace and for their personal gain. <p></p> It is hard to tell what offends Phillips the most: the Bushes' systematic deceit and secrecy, their shady business dealings, their cronyism, or their family philosophy that privileges the very wealthy and utterly dismisses all the rest. It is clearly all of these things combined. But at the top of Phillips' list is the dynastic nature of their family power, for it is that concentration of power and influence that strikes at the heart of our democracy. Past administrations have transgressed, albeit not so egregiously, and other political families have had dynastic ambitions. But none have succeeded as thoroughly as the Bushes. Jefferson and Madison would be horrified, and according to Phillips, we should be too. --<i>Silvana Tropea</i><p>Kevin Phillips has been a political and economic commentator for more than three decades.

In May, they begin thinking of all the preparations that will keep them busy throughout the next seven months. They plant "one" seed at a time, bake "two" rhubarb pies, collect "three" warm summer memories, and so on until they get to "ten" skis, "eleven" friends celebrating the end of the season of chores, and "twelve" inches of snow, which launch the beginning of skiing, skating, and snowman-building fun. <p> Although the premise of <i>Gathering</i> is a counting book, it's really more a celebration of a unique lifestyle that few of us know as intimately as author Betsy Bowen, who's spent more than 25 years on the north shore of Lake Superior with her family. The joy of this experience shines through in this charming book, illustrated with beautiful, bright, and rather intricate woodcuts. "All day long we ski on the fresh snow; we find our familiar trails and discover some new ones, too. Tonight we'll gather around the fire to thaw our feet and drink hot cider. We're settled in for winter now. Before long we'll count the days until spring."</p>Betsy Bowen is the author-illustrator of several books for children. Reviewers have described her distinctive woodcuts as bold, rich and handsome. The mother of three sons, she has lived with her family on the rugged north shore of Lake Superior in Minnesota for more than thirty years.</p><h2>Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy</h2><p>Toward the goal of reorienting ethics away from rigid systems and toward the individual, a noted philosopher criticizes systematic moral theory from Kant on and elucidates a provocative alternate view</p><p><b>Bernard Williams</b> is White's Professor of Moral Philosophy, Oxford, and Deutsch Professor of Philosophy, University of California at Berkeley.Who has not asked--if only when depressed--"How should I live, and how can I find out?" To read this book is to be taken through one of the most sophisticated discussions available of such questions by an engaging, skeptical, often wryly witty and extraordinarily subtle professional.<br> --Ronald de Sousa (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Bernard Williams's book is better read not as an introduction to ethics, but as an attempt to take stock of the present state of the subject. As such, it is a splendid piece of work It illuminatingly maps the various tendencies and the difficulties which they encounter...Such stocktaking is much needed. Bernard Williams is probably the philosopher best placed to undertake it, and he has done it admirably.<br> --Richard Norman (<i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br>Remarkably lively and enjoyable...It is a very rich book, containing excellent descriptions of a variety of moral theories, and innumerable original and often witty observations on topics encountered on the way.<br> --Philippa Foot (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)</p><h2>The architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright,: A complete catalog</h2><p>Clean copy, but no dust cover.</p><p>Over the past decade, there has been a significant revival of interest in the architecture and designs of Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959). From Barnsdall Park in Los Angeles to the Zimmerman house in New Hampshire, from Florida Southern College to Taliesin in Wisconsin, with Fallingwater in between, Frank Lloyd Wright buildings open to the public receive thousands of visitors each year, and there is a thriving commerce in reproductions of Wright's furniture and fabric designs. Among the many books available on Frank Lloyd Wright, William Allin Storrer's classic&#x2014;now fully revised and updated&#x2014;remains the only authoritative guide to all of Wright's built work.<br><br>This edition includes a number of new features. It provides information on Frank Lloyd Wright buildings discovered since the first edition. It features full-color photographs to highlight those buildings that remain essentially as they were first built. To facilitate its use as a convenient field guide, this durable flexibound edition gives full addresses with each entry, as well as GPS coordinates, and offers maps giving the shortest route to each building. Preserving the chronological order of past editions, the catalog allows readers to trace the progression of Frank Lloyd Wright's built designs from the early Prairie school works to the last building constructed to Wright's specifications on the original site&#x2014;the Aime and Norman Lykes residence.<br><br><i>The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright</i> will be indispensable for anyone fascinated with Wright's unique architectural genius.<b>William Allin Storrer</b> holds a Ph.D. in comparative arts.

They blast into the midst of the Trojan War, confusing Greeks and Trojans alike and for a moment forcing those enemies into a terrified alliance. When Achilles, the pride and mainstay of the Greeks, and Penthesilea (<i>Pen-te-sil-lay-uh</i>), queen of the Amazons, meet, a chase begins,</p><i>The like of which not even the wildest storms <br>Set loose to thunder across the plain of heaven<br>Have yet presented to the astonished world,<br></i><p>and it is the queen who is hunting Achilles, to the uncomprehending horror of the Greeks. Thus begins a tragedy of love in a world governed by the rules of war, on which "the gods look down but from afar."</p><p>For the first time, in this splendidly illustrated book, an English translation recreates the audaity, romance, and poetry of one of the strangest and most beautiful works of Western literature.</p></p><p>Heinrich von Kleist (1777-1811) was virtually forgotten until the beginning of the twentieth century, when Rilke, Kafka, and Thomas Mann hailed him as a master of German prose and European dramatic literature. During Kleist&#39;s lifetime, Goethe, sensing in the younger man his greatest rival, carefully withheld from him the endorsement that would have established his reputation. At the age of thirty-four, impoverished and in debt, despairing of the literary honor he had hoped to gain for his family, Kleist consummated a suicide pact with an incurably ill married woman. Ironically, the spectacular circumstances of his death helped to rescue his oeuvre--primarily eight stories and eight plays--from oblivion.<p>Scene One<br></p><p>[<i>Enter</i> Odysseus <i>and</i> Diomedes <i>from one</i><br>Antilochus <i>from the other, with soldiers.</i>]<br></p><p>Antilochus<br>My greetings to you, Kings! How have you fared <br>Since last we met before the gates of Troy?<br></p><p>Odysseus<br>Badly, Antilochus. As you can see, <br>The armies of the Greeks and Amazons <br>Are locked in battle like two raging wolves. <br>I swear by Jupiter, they don't know why! <br>Unless Mars in his fury, or Apollo, <br>Takes them in hand, unless cloud-shaking Zeus <br>Cleaves them apart with storm and thunderbolt: <br>They will lie dead before the end of day, <br>Each with its teeth sunk in the other's throat.<br>Bring me a helmet full of water.<br></p><p>Antilochus<br>Wait!<br>These Amazons-what do they want of us?<br></p><p>Odysseus<br>The two of us, on Agamemnon's counsel,<br>Set out with all the Myrmidons behind us,<br>Achilles and myself; Penthesilea,<br>We'd heard, had risen in the Scythian forests,<br>Leading an army, dressed in serpent skins,<br>Of Amazons, burning with lust for war,<br>By winding turns through mountainous terrain,<br>To shield King Priam and break our siege of Troy.<br>Then, by Scamander's bank, news reaches us<br>That Deiphobus, the Priamid, has also<br>Set forth in armed array, from Ilium,<br>To meet the Queen, who's coming near with help,<br></p><p>And greet her as a friend. Now we devour <br>The highway, hoping to forfend against <br>The ominous alliance of such foes <br>By stepping in between. All night we march. <br>But with the first dim reddening of dawn, <br>Amazement seizes us, Antilochus: <br>In a wide valley at our feet we see <br>The Amazons in combat with the troops <br>Of Deiphobus! And, like a hurricane <br>Dispersing shredded clouds, Penthesilea <br>Blasting the Trojan ranks in headlong sweep <br>As if to blow them past the Hellespont <br>And off the edge of Earth.<br></p><p>Antilochus<br>Strange, by our god!<br></p><p>Odysseus <br>We close our ranks to shield against their flight, <br>Which thunders in upon us like the wedge <br>Of an attacking phalanx, and conjoin <br>Our spears to form a solid wall against them. <br>Beholding this, Deiphobus hesitates; <br>And we, conferring hastily, decide <br>To greet Penthesilea as an ally: <br>The while she, too, stems her triumphant course. <br>Was ever simpler, sounder counsel taken? <br>If I had asked Athena for advice, <br>Could she have whispered anything more shrewd? <br>She has no choice, this maiden! Having dropped <br>From heaven, clad for war, into our midst <br>To mingle in our fight-what choice has she, <br>Except to side with one against the other? <br>She must, by Hades! And we likewise must <br>Presume her friendly, since she battles Troy.<br></p><p>Antilochus<br>Why, yes, by the river Styx! It clearly follows.<br></p><p>Odysseus<br>Well, then. Achilles goes with me to greet<br>The Scythian heroine where she sits mounted<br>In martial panoply before her maids, <br>Plumes flowing from her helmet, skirt tucked high, <br>Her palfrey tossing gold and purple tassels, <br>Hooves stamping on the muddy ground beneath. <br>For one long moment, with a pensive gaze <br>She stares into our ranks, void of expression, <br>As if we stood before her carved in stone; <br>This bare flat palm has more expressive features <br>Than were displayed upon that woman's face: <br>Until her glance meets that of Peleus' son: <br>A deepening flush spreads down unto her neck, <br>Blood sets her face aglow as if the world <br>Surrounding her were leaping into flames. <br>Then, with a sudden jolt, she swings herself <br>Casting a somber scowl upon Achilles<br>Down from her horse, and, stepping toward us, leaves <br>The reins with an attendant, and inquires <br>What brings us to her in such pageantry. <br>We Argives, I reply, are highly pleased <br>To come upon an enemy of Troy; <br>Long has a hatred for the sons of Priam <br>Consumed our hearts, I say; great benefit <br>Would be our Joint reward if we were friends; <br>And other suchlike bounties of the moment. <br>But then I notice in the flow of talking: <br>She doesn't hear a word. Instead, she turns <br>And with a look of utter wonderment, <br>Suddenly like a girl, a sixteen-year-old <br>On her way back from the Olympic Games, <br>Addresses a companion by her side: <br>Oh Prothoï¿½, I do not think my mother, <br>Otrerï¿½, ever laid eyes on such a man!<br>The friend, embarrassed at these words, stays silent, <br>Achilles smiles at me, and I at him, <br>While she herself stands gazing, as if drunk <br>With admiration, at that glittering figure: <br>Until her friend reminds her timidly <br>That she still owes an answer to my words.<br></p><p>Whether from rage or shame, another blush <br>Staining her harness crimson to the waist, <br>She turns to me, confusion, wildness, pride <br>Commingling in her face, and speaks: <br>I am Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons, <br>And you shall have my arrows for reply!<br></p><p>Antilochus <br>So, word for word, your messenger reported; <br>But no one in the entire Grecian camp <br>Could comprehend it.<br></p><p>Odysseus<br>Nor could we.

This herald, though, has just begun <br>To shake the dust off his cuirass and shield, <br>When, sweeping in upon us one and all, <br>Trojans and Greeks alike, that centauress <br>Comes flying, reins hung slack, with all the force <br>And rampant frenzy of a cataract.<br></p><p>Antilochus<br>Truly astounding, Danaeans!<br></p><p>Odysseus<br>And now begins <br>A struggle, friend, such as had not been fought <br>Since Gala loosed the Furies on this world. <br>I thought till now that Nature knows but force <br>And counterforce, and no third power besides. <br>Whatever quenches fire will not bring water <br>Seething to a boll, nor vice versa.<br></p></p><h2>John Baldessari</h2><p>A fascinating look at conceptual artist, John Baldessari his work often attempts to point out irony in contemporary art theory and practices or reduce it to absurdity. His art has been featured in more than 200 solo exhibitions in the U.S. and Europe. Much of Baldessari&#39;s work involves pointing, in which he tells the viewer not only what to look at but how to make selections and comparisons, often simply for the sake of doing so. He is known for his statement &#34;If I saw the art around me that I liked, then I wouldn&#39;t do art.&#34;</p><p>Juxtaposing images from popular culture and mundane reality, conceptual artist Baldessari turns the vernacular of mass perception back on itself, jolting viewers out of programmed ways of seeing. An artist with a keen sense of humor and an instinctive feel for the absurdity of much of modern culture, he creates open-ended messages, clues for the spectator to decipher. Wedding 375 plates to a perceptive essay that tracks the Southern Californian's ever-shifting modes, this monograph--a tie-in with a touring retrospective--explores Baldessari's imagist "mind games" of the 1960s and '70s, text-and-image parables, composite photoworks blending newsreel-like reportage with fabrication, collages and installations. Van Bruggen ( Bruce Nauman ) illuminates how Baldessari wrests poetry, meaning and hope from alchemical fusions of movie stills, words, billboard posters, ads, old photographs and art-historical references. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Contemporary art aficionados will appreciate Conceptualist John Baldessari's jarring juxtapositions of imagery drawn from popular culture, including photographs and texts appropriated from advertising, magazine articles, television, and film. This broad selection of his work, here presented in 375 photographs, challenges viewers to confront the idiosyncracies and banal details of modern American life. This book, the first full-scale monograph on Baldessari and catalog for an exhibition that will be shown at six U.S. and Canadian venues through 1992, offers a lucid account of his development over the last three decades and a discussion of the narrative and psychological themes in his work. Van Bruggen, an independent curator and wife of Pop artist Claes Oldenberg, is also the author of Bruce Nauman (Rizzoli, 1989).<br><i>- Russell T. Clement, Brigham Young Univ. Lib., Provo, Ut.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Chang and Eng: A Novel</h2><p>A fictional retelling of the lives of Chang and Eng Bunker--the original &#34;Siamese twins&#34;--from their lives of poverty in Siam to their success in the United States</p><p>Narrated by Eng, one of a pair of conjoined twins, <i>Chang and Eng</i> is a daring novel that constantly threatens to lose its balance. It's also one that would be hard to believe were it not rigorously grounded in historical fact. Like the (literally) inseparable protagonists of Darin Strauss's debut, Chang and Eng Bunker were born in the early 1800s in a rainy village on the shores of the Mekong Delta. Achieving instant fame as the "Siamese double boy," they toured freak shows throughout China, Europe, and North America. Eventually they settled in North Carolina (of all places), married a pair of sisters, and fathered 21 children between them.<p> This fictionalized version of their story is narrated by the stronger, more circumspect twin, Eng, who must continually urge Chang to restrain his tears, his burning sexual desires, and his fear of the King of Siam (who has promised to "kill the double-child, the bad omen"). From the beginning, Strauss masterfully delineates the brothers' differences. Yet it's the porous nature of their relationship that will fascinate readers even more. The twins, after all, must always sleep face to face, connected by a fleshy band and the knowledge of their shared monstrosity. The fact that they are neither "he" nor "we" allows the author myriad opportunities for wordplay and psychological riddles. Does Chang love his brother, or does he love himself? When he hates his brother, is it only a piece of himself he is hating? Might the connecting band be its own entity, a pet that the brothers must tend to and feed? When they were children, Eng recalls, the band </p><blockquote> was about two inches long, and Chang loved it. He called it Tzon, or ripe banana, and wailed if ever I mentioned severing it. It was more taut then, and would crackle like an old knee when we inched closer or farther apart (no one had any idea the thing would grow with us, and one day allow lateral positioning). I often fidgeted with a stretch of brown leathery skin--a hairy birthmark--midway across it, and also a little brown dot, a charming dinky island that lived, insolently, just free from the shoreline of the larger birthmark. </blockquote> The novel's agile prose is like a smooth, strong current, pulling the twins away from their awkward lives. To his great credit, Strauss spends very little time dwelling on Chang and Eng as monsters, and their freak-show existence surfaces only in short, painful flashbacks--a jeering interlude that the narrator would sooner forget. And Eng's voice is a compelling one, full of quips, insecurities, and jealousy. Indeed, at some moments he seems like a standard-issue Renaissance man, reading Shakespeare in the afternoon, dreaming about pretty women, recounting his extensive travels. Yet the tragic fact remains: no matter how many countries this cosmopolitan visits, he will never have a room to himself. <i>--Emily White</i>Darin Strauss is the award-winning author of the national and international bestseller <b>Chang and Eng</b>, as well as its screenplay for Disney Films and director Julie Taymor.&nbsp; His work has been translated into 14 languages and he teaches at New York University and lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p><h2>The Ufo Enigma: The Definitive Explanation of the Ufo Phenomenon</h2><p>Contends that UFOs are easily explainable meteorological and optical phenomena and explains each of the most publicized sightings between 1963 and 1975</p><p></p><h2>Snow</h2><p>Todd Curry wants nothing more than to spend Christmas with his son.

So argues Tom Eamon in his probing narrative of the state's political path since the 1940s.

As To the Stars tackles the existential problems of relativity and coming-of-age, a cast of talented pros, strong character development, and sterling production values make this a rich listen. Special kudos to Jim Meskimen as the terse, enigmatic Captain Jocelyn and to the sound effects team for a smashing, lush job.

Finally, Summer Cooking has chapters on hors d&#39;oeuvres, summer soups, vegetables, sauces and sweets that are full of ideas for fresh, cool food all summer long. &#39;Not only did she transform the way we cooked but she is a delight to read&#39; Express on Sunday &#39;Britain&#39;s most inspirational food writer&#39; Independent &#39;When you read Elizabeth David, you get perfect pitch.

Having travelled widely during the Second World War, she introduced post-war Britain to the sun-drenched delights of the Mediterranean and her recipes brought new flavours and aromas into kitchens across Britain. After her classic first book Mediterranean Food followed more bestsellers, including French Country Cooking, Summer Cooking, French Provincial Cooking, Italian Food, Elizabeth David&#39;s Christmas and At Elizabeth David&#39;s Table.</p><p><b>Elizabeth David&nbsp;</b>(1913-1992) was a legendary writer and cook. In 1950, she published&nbsp;<i>Mediterranean Food</i>&nbsp;and along with subsequent books, including&nbsp;<i>Italian Food&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>French Provincial Cooking</i>,&nbsp;changed the face of cookery in Britain for ever. In her later works she explored the traditions of English cooking and is widely considered Britain's greatest twentieth-century cookery writer. Her books continue to inspire many today, who find her philosophy of simplicity, authenticity, knowledge and care to their liking. She received a CBE in 1986."Decorated with a portrait of twin cherries, yellow runner beans, and the sweet, petite wild strawberries known as frais de bois, to urban eyes starved of July's sensual delights, the sunny cover of <i>Summer Cooking </i>seems to promise a storybook world...<i>Summer Cooking</i> is a wonderfully subversive volume -- every bit as unexpected and enchanting to read today as it must have been 50 years ago...But the purest thrill of <i>Summer Cooking</i>,as in all of David's volumes, is the nearly pugilistic punch of pleasure her food delivers, and the graceful way her bright, well-mannered prose captures the artist's fleeting delight...Whether read in bed in a baking tenement or at the breezy desk of a lolling barge, her words still ring like hypnotic prayers." --Salon.com</p><h2>Half the Perfect World: Writers, Dreamers and Drifters on Hydra, 1955-1964 (Biography)</h2><p><i>Half the Perfect World</i> is an account of the expatriate artist community on the Greek island of Hydra from 1955 to 1964.&nbsp;Fostered by celebrated Australian literary couple Charmian Clift and George Johnston, this fabled 'colony' came to include&nbsp;Leonard Cohen and numerous other writers and artists. What brought this group to Hydra? What does their story reveal about the post-war world? Looking at the Hydra expatriates through their writing, letters, diaries, and photographs, Genoni and Dalziell identify a deep restlessness within a rapidly changing time of emerging social movements and counter-cultures, shifting geo-political realities, incipient pop-cultures, new technologies of communication and entertainment, and altered understandings of what it meant to live as an expatriate artist.</p><p><p><b>Paul Genoni</b>&nbsp;works with the School of Media, Culture, and Creative Arts at Curtin University.&nbsp;<b>Tanya Dalziell</b>&nbsp;works in English and Cultural Studies at the University of Western Australia.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Posters of the First World War</h2><p>Daddy, what did <i>you</i> do in the Great War?<br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t waste bread! Save two slices every day and defeat the &#x2018;U&#x2019; boat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of the most dramatic and compelling efforts to rally the public during World War I came in the form of posters. <i>Posters of the First World War </i>collects more than one hundred posters from America, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy that showcase renewed concern among the warring nations with national character and conduct. Many of the recruitment posters liken the act of joining the military to becoming a man, introducing the now-familiar figures of Tommy in the trenches or the swarthy French <i>poilu.</i> Others are concerned with rationing or fund-raising, urging Americans, for instance, to &#x201c;Beat back the Hun with Liberty Bonds!&#x201d; In Germany, where a <i>blockade prohibited the import of food and other necessities, </i>posters suggest resourceful alternatives, encouraging children to collect nettles and fruit seeds for oil.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Many of the posters in this collection remain iconic, but others&#x2015;while no less fascinating&#x2015;have been largely forgotten. <i>Posters of the First World War</i> provides a rich slice of social history, pairing the posters with an explanation of what they were trying to<br> achieve and their cultural and social significance.</p><p><b>Richard Slocombe </b>is a senior curator at the Imperial War Museums.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Country Doctor: A Memoir</h2><p>Starting with his first patient, a horse, Ben Dlin discovered that rural doctors are called upon to do things that he never dreamed of when he was an intern.<br><br>"I learned that I had to be prepared to do anything, any time and any place, without regard for the hour, the inconvenience, the exhaustion and the absence of assistance."<br><br>Set in the post-war period of the 1940s and early 50s, Dlin recounts the responsibility of being the one person who is called upon in emergencies to make split-second decisions that can impact patients and their families for life. "I believed then and I still believe now that every student of medicine should spend time in rural practice. It is the place to discover what you're made of. But more importantly, it is the best place to learn the profession. Within the novice it creates a lifelong humanistic approach to medicine that remains no matter what specialty is pursued."</p><p>Born of European Jewish refugees, Ben Dlin has led an unusual life. He grew up in the only Jewish family in Bruderheim, northern Alberta. An indifferent student with an attitude problem in high school, he became a leading psychiatrist in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He now splits his time between Pender Harbour, BC, and Philadelphia. &#39;Country Doctor&#39; is his first book.The hospital also had its "bedlam" wards, much like that portrayed in the classic movie <i>One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest</i>. Most of the staff members were somewhat weird themselves; many of them could, in fact, be easily mistaken for patients, and since the patients could sense illness, it affected their trust in their caregivers. One of the younger staff doctors, an overtly effeminate homosexual, was severely beaten one day for no obvious reason when he went to his assigned job in the closed, disturbed female ward.<br><br>Although the most violent and uncontrolled patients, some with and some without clothes, remained locked in padded cells, this one ward housed more than a hundred psychotic women ranging from manic depressives to catatonic schizophrenics. Many were dangerous. They wandered barefoot in drab, shapeless cotton dresses; mumbling, screaming, begging, pleading, masturbating, rocking, or just standing or sitting like statues in one fixed position. When it was time for bed they would be herded to their locked sleeping quarters down the hall.<br><br>It was this unit of suicidal, homicidal patients and other psychotics that I was assigned to take over. Naively, I unlocked the door and stepped into a world of bedlam. Almost immediately a huge woman about six inches taller than I and weighing at least 280 pounds walked up to me and said in a heavy, authoritative German accent, "I take care of you!" Whereupon she reached over and picked me up with one arm and began carrying me around the unit. I was safe. I had the protection of the toughest woman I'd ever met in my life. "Vee go here or "Vee go dare," she would say.<br><br>When I felt comfortable enough with her, I'd say, "Take me over dare," or "Vud you please pud me down und vate for me here," and she would comply. For the whole time I was in charge of the unit, she was my companion. I never read her chart because I was afraid that I might discover that she had killed her husband and her children. It seemed best just to carry on with the illusion that she was my protector. There was just not enough time to read all the charts, anyway. The focus instead was on handling each crisis as it arose and in dispensing medication.<br><br>Most of my chores were directed to dispensing medication for the epileptics, sedatives for the agitated, and electroshock for the depressed. <br><br>During these rounds I would also be on the lookout for physical illness or injury. Many women refused to eat, and without daily tube feedings most of them would have certainly died of starvation.<br><br>It was interesting to note that open, compulsive masturbation was far more common in the female than in the male units. I wondered if that had to do with the taboo at that time against masturbation. It came to me that the authors of those old textbooks on descriptive psychiatry must have assumed that since crazy people masturbated excessively, it was therefore a part of the reason for their being sick.<br><br>From time to time I noticed a thin older woman, with a greatly distended abdomen as she slunk around the ward. She looked nine months pregnant. I thought that she might have a gigantic tumor, but when I finally examined her, I discovered that the cause of the swelling was a massive faecal impaction. The nurse on duty had no idea that she had stopped having bowel movements. There was nothing to be done but to begin removing the faeces manually.<br><br>We got her onto a table and I proceeded to remove stool that was mixed with glass, stones and other foreign objects which she had either swallowed or inserted up her bum. I must have torn a dozen pairs of rubber gloves as I dug and dug, filling buckets with her bowel products. I would have preferred using a shovel. All the while this was being done the patient screamed. When I was finished and she was cleaned up, she leaped from the table and disappeared into the crowd like a wild animal running for shelter into the forest.<br><br>Three times a week I administered electroshock treatments. Though rather primitive at that time, it was still one of best tools available to help those who suffered from depression, agitation and mania. Unfortunately, it was useless for most other conditions.<br><br>Food was not allowed prior to the shock treatment in order to avoid aspirating stomach contents and to decrease bladder incontinence. The patient would lie on a table with two attendants on either side, two holding arms and shoulders while the other two held onto shins and thighs. A fifth attendant would place a roll of gauze into the mouth for the patient to clamp down on, then support the chin and head. This way the body was given some protection when the patient went into the post-electroshock grand-mal seizure, but they were given nothing to alleviate the terrible physical trauma that the body had to endure.<br><br>My job was to administer the shock. I felt like some mad scientist from a Frankenstein movie as I set the voltage on the control box so that when the button was depressed an electric impulse would travel through wires that connected to the ice-tong-like instrument that I held. The ends of the tong were wrapped in gauze pads that had been soaked saline solution to improve conductivity. I would apply these wet ends to the patient's right and left temple, and we were all set for "blast off." I'd say "Ready," and all five people would bear down with all their strength. Instantly the entire body went into severe, continuous protracted spasm, which was followed by a series of powerful convulsions that lasted about a full minute. The force was so great that the convulsions often caused compression fractures of the patient's spine.<br><br>On one occasion the nurse forgot to wring out the excess solution from the gauze ends, and some of the brine leaked onto my hands and onto the hands of the nurse supporting the patient's head and chin. When I depressed the button the patient had a seizure and both the nurse and I followed along with seizures of our arms. It was a crazy morning. I told the nurse that it might well result in our having subsequent personality changes!<br><br>Most patients came willingly and without fuss for their shock treatments, waiting in line as if it were a dental appointment. After the treatment they would go into a recovery area, sleep for a while and then be taken back to their wards. Amnesia was both a complication and a blessing of shock therapy. On the one hand, it helped to erase the frightening memory of the event, but it often led to a profound confusion that could last weeks and even months.<br><br>There were two other forms of treatment for severely disturbed patients. One was very tricky to manage: insulin shock therapy. Patients were given a dose of insulin to produce severe hypoglycemia or a fall in blood sugar, resulting in profound sweating and stupor. Occasionally, they would have a seizure. Then we would administer intravenous glucose, thereby satisfying the excess insulin circulating through the body. The patient would wake up drenched in sweat, sleep for a while, eat, and then be returned to his or her unit. Other than sedating the patient and providing a lot of attention, I saw little if any benefit from this treatment.<br><br>The final form of treatment for the severely disturbed, a very ancient one, was to wrap the patient in woolen blankets soaked in ice-cold water. Within a short time, the body heat of the patient would rise and be kept constant by the wool swaddling. The patient would become calm, perspire profusely and usually fall into a restful sleep. Later he or she would be toweled off, and then indulged with food and fluids. This treatment provided the same temporary effect In tension reduction that one might get by sitting in a hot tub or a Turkish steam bath.<br><br>Years later, when I attended a meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society, I heard a very interesting paper dealing with the therapeutic effects of regressive psychotherapy. As I listened, it occurred to me that this is what had been taking place with our swaddled psychotic patients in Ponoka. The technique apparently took the patient back to feeling like a completely dependent child, his entire needs anticipated in such a manner that he was, for all practical purposes, reduced to the emotional age of one or two.<br><br>An entirely new process, the prefrontal lobotomy, was done on patients with severe obsessive-compulsive disease and on patients whose violence could not be controlled. Our chief of neurosurgery at the university, Dr. H. H. Hepburn, would drive down from Edmonton to do the surgery, and I was pleased whenever he requested that I assist him. One of the approaches he used was to burr holes through both temples; the other was to approach the brain through the thin bony orbit of the eyes. In both procedures a thin stainless steel probe was inserted into the brain and then the surgeon would sweep the probe in such a manner as to sever each frontal lobe from the rest of the brain.<br><br>After surgery it was necessary to re-educate these patients in almost everything. They had become docile little children. However, after all this tedious retraining, they would revert to the way they were before surgery, the crippling mental illness returning with no hope of ever getting better. All was for naught. This "ice pick" operation was a brutal one that illustrates the extent to which frustrated neuropsychiatrists would go to find the 'cure' for mental illness. Today, we use simple medications to deal with the same sorts of illnesses.<br><br>It always amazed me when some woman approached me in the midst of this bedlam and said in the most rational tone of voice, 'Doctor, I am okay now." After spending time with her, I would move her gradually through the various gates to healthier and healthier units until she was discharged. I had no idea why, or how, these patients got better.<br><br>There were also a few young women in their late teens or earlv twenties who had been admitted to the bedlam wards because of the sudden onset of insanity. I spent hours with these young inmates looking for some way to reach them. I recall taking one young woman for long walks in the garden and around the grounds. A university student, she chatted at first about the things around us, then finally began talking about her family. I felt this was important progress in someone who was diagnosed as having "simple schizophrenia" because schizophrenics are characteristically void of emotion and so withdrawn they have nothing to say. But when I reported my observations at the next staff conference, I was told by the senior staff, "Don't waste your time. She is a hopeless simple schizophrenic!"<br><br>Many years later, when I was on the faculty of medicine at Temple University Health Science Center, one of my post-graduate students observed that most young girls with a first time admission to a mental hospital had their psychotic break because of an incestuous relationship with their fathers. I thought back to that young university student and wondered if she had been such a victim.<br><br>Our regular staff meetings were held in a large conference chamber that looked like a courtroom, with the jury of doctors and nurses sitting in a semi-circle. Patients were brought in one at a time and seated on a straight-backed chair in the center of this courtroom to be questioned like prisoners. The interrogation was brief, and after the patient was excused, decisions would be made as to diagnosis and disposition. It was medieval, and I realized that Ponoka was simply a cleaner version of insane asylums that had existed a hundred years earlier.<br><br>One evening while on general hospital duty I was making rounds in the chronically ill male unit when I noticed a young man leaping up and down on his bed and making noises like a one-year-old. He looked familiar. I went over to get a closer look, and to my horror I recognized Kasa, a Japanese boy who had been my high school classmate. A bright and studious kid, he had sat in front of me in algebra class. When I read his record, I learned that he and his sister had contracted congenital syphilis in utero because both parents were silent carriers of the disease. Kasa would not live long because he was suffering from general paresis of the insane, a late stage of syphilis that destroys the brain.<br><br>My time at the hospital was not all work. Dances and other social events were held for the open unit patients, who had the freedom to do as they wished, and the younger staff members were encouraged to attend. I found it really fun dancing and chatting sensibly with women whom I knew and cared for, who had been psychotic only a week or two before.<br><br>I also became very good friends with Gladys, a terrific girl who had come from Edmonton with another nurse to earn a few extra bucks and get away from home. We had a great time together and, as was usual for me, I had a major problem controlling my passions. She did too, so we "suffered" the joys of passionate love-making without guilt or regret.<br><br>All in all, Ponoka was a fascinating experience. I had seen a slice of medicine that I hoped I'd never witness again. For many of us that spring, our brief jobs marked the end of having to grub for money. I had completed and paid in full for an intensive, accelerated, six-year pre-medical and medical program. Soon we would all be entering a twelve-month hospital training program. As interns each of us would have our own small room with maid service, meals and a salary of twenty-five dollars month. White uniforms were included. Now that's what I call living!</p><h2>Shut Up and Sing: How Elites from Hollywood, Politics, and the UN Are Subverting America</h2><p>Feisty radio sensation Laura Ingraham is tired of the Hollywood Left--and she has all the answers in this pugnacious, funny, and devastating critique of the liberals who hate America</p><p>MEET THE ELITES. <p>They think you're stupid. They think all freedom loving Americans are stupid. They think patriotism is stupid. They think churchgoing is stupid. They think flag-flying is stupid. They despise families with more than two children. They are sure that where we live - anywhere but near or in a few major cities - is an insipid cultural wasteland. </p><p>They think your SUV is evil - although theirs is absolutely necessary. They think owning a gun is criminal. They think George Bush is an idiot. They even think it's wrong for us to do what we have to do to protect our nation and our loved ones. Worst of all, they think our abiding belief in the goodness of America and its founding principles is naï¿½ve and misguided. </p><p>But in this refreshing and blisteringly insightful look at the elites, Laura Ingraham reveals that it is they, not us, who are pickled in prejudice, morally blind, and outrageously hypocritical. In a word, it is they who are stupid. Ingraham exposes the outrageous howlers and muddled thinking peddled by a rogue's gallery of Hollywood celebs, media yuppies, trial lawyers, multiculturalists, God-haters, and race-relations bullies who are exalted as heroes by the elite. </p><p>Ingraham unmasks the shallowness of elite thinking everywhere it is found: in politics, the media, the ivory tower, arts and entertainment, and even business and international organizations. Nor does she restrict her skewering of the elite only to its natural home, the Democratic Party - she ably zeroes in on elite enclaves within the GOP as well. </p><p>Ingraham reveals: <br>* Why the elites want America to be torn down, tradition by tradition <br>* The real reason Hollywood is politically moronic: including a case study of "Stupid White Man" Michael Moore <br>* How to understand the goals of the elite - and spot their tactics <br>* Why the elites are "theophobic" - and bent on eradicating religion from American life <br>* The antiwar crowd: anti-Americanism in disguise. <br>* Why our current immigration policies border on insanity <br>* How our colleges and schools try to brainwash students in political correctness and anti-Americanism <br>* The UN: why this darling of the elites desperately needs to be reformed, reconfigured, and reoriented <br>* Why the elites are either losing or on shaky ground on most issues </p><p>Meet the elites.

And Mas, busy tending lawns, gambling, and struggling to put his Hiroshima past behind him, never had much time for the family he was trying to support. For years now, his resentful daughter has lived a continent away in New York City, and had a life he knew little about. But an anxious phone call from Mari asking for his help plunges the usually obstinate Mas into a series of startling situations from maneuvering in an unfamiliar city to making nice with his tall, blond son-in-law, Lloyd, to taking care of a sickly child...to finding a dead body in the rubble of a former koi pond. <br><br>The victim was Kazzy Ouchi, a half-Japanese millionaire who also happened to be Mari and Lloyd&#x2019;s boss. Stumbling onto the scene, Mas sees more amiss than the detectives do, but his instinct is to keep his mouth shut. Only when the case threatens his daughter and her family does Mas take action: patiently, stubbornly tugging at the end of a tangled, dangerous mystery. And as he does, he begins to lay bare a tragic secret on the dark side of an American dream....<br><br>Both a riveting mystery and a powerful story of passionate relationships across a cultural divide,<b> Gasa-Gasa Girl</b> is a tale told with heart and wisdom: an unforgettable portrait of fathers, daughters, and other strangers.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Naomi Hirahara is a freelance writer and journalist who served for several years as an editor of <i>The Rafu Shimpo</i>, the largest Japanese American daily newspaper.

Even in the best neighborhoods in Beverly Hills or San Marino back in Southern California, lawns lay open like luxurious carpets to the edges of sidewalks, beckoning guests and the glances of envious passersby. Of course, back home there were also visual threats and warnings&#x2013;the blue and yellow Armed Response signs on metal stakes. But it was one thing to pierce grass with a sign, and quite another to put a garden behind bars.<br><br>"It's called a community garden," Tug Yamada explained. "Everyone pitches in to make it green." <br><br>They were stuck in traffic on Flatbush Avenue. Tug had picked Mas up in a white Mercury rental car, a pearl amid the black Town Cars that had circled JFK Airport. Mas could always count on Tug to help him in a pinch. But then again, Mas guessed that Tug was behind this recent turn of events. It would take an outside force&#x2013;specifically a six-foot Nisei, a second-generation Japanese American&#x2013;to push Mas's daughter, Mari, to place a call from Brooklyn to his home in Altadena.<br><br>"Community? Like Japanese ones back in Los Angeles?"<br><br>"No Japanese gardeners over here, Mas. At least no more than you can count on one hand." Tug stretched out his palm, magnifying the missing half of his forefinger, a remnant of his war injury in Europe.<br><br>This was no place for Japanese gardeners and no place for a Kibei like Mas, who was born in the U.S. but raised in Japan. Kibei&#x2013;"ki" meaning "return," "bei" referring to America&#x2013;was a word made up by Japanese Americans to explain their limbo. So while America was actually home for the Kibei, many of them weren't quite comfortable with English; on the other hand, they weren't that comfortable speaking Japanese, either.<br><br>Mas was used to not belonging, but he felt an especially strong sense of displacement the minute he'd gotten on the plane. A bunch of hakujin and blacks, and a few young Chinese. There were a couple of Japanese, but they were business types who wore blue and black suits with ties and hard shoes even on the airplane. They sat in the front, behind a curtain that separated the first class from the rest of the plane, called economy but really meaning bimbo, for the passengers with no money, like Mas. Even when Mas returned to America from Hiroshima in 1947, he bought the third-class boat tickets, which turned out to be a large open room full of other teenage dreamers lying on goza, straw mats, on the bottom of the ship.<br><br>In the streets of New York, there were black and brown teenagers with the same look in their eyes. Wrapped in puffy jackets and their heads topped with knit caps, they seemed to hold their dreams casually, maybe recklessly, as if those dreams could never dry up.<br><br>"Everyone gasa-gasa ova here, huh?"<br><br>"Yeah, everyone moves around in New York, Mas. You should see where Joy lives in Manhattan. It's like rivers of people walking at night."<br><br>Tug had been in New York for a couple of weeks now before the opening of his daughter Joy's art exhibit. In Mas's eyes, Tug was the closest thing to an expert on Manhattan. "Joy live close to ova here?"<br><br>"You have to go over the Brooklyn Bridge, but it's just a short subway ride away."<br><br>"Fancy place, dis Manhattan?"<br><br>"Well, Joy lives in a postage stamp of an apartment. The water comes out all brown." Tug stroked his white beard. "And you know how I love baths, Mas."<br><br>Tug, in fact, had installed a Jacuzzi tub, his and his wife Lil's only extravagance, in their modest home just two miles east of Mas's. There was no doubt that this love for baths started when Tug was a child simmering nightly in the family furo, the huge Japanese wooden tub, on their red chili pepper farm.<br><br>Mas asked a few more perfunctory questions about Joy, then cut to the chase. "So you knowsu whatsu goin' on with Mari?"<br><br>"I'd better let her and Lloyd explain."<br><br>Lloyd? Mas had barely thought of his new son-in-law. "Not the baby&#x2013;?" Mas couldn't even say the name: Takeo Frederick Jensen. It was too long; and why had they named the child Takeo, anyhow?<br><br>Mari had sent a photo back in December of a little red monkey-faced infant with fists curled up like cooked shrimp. You couldn't tell if the baby looked more Japanese or hakujin or something in between. Mas remembered when Mari had been that small. He was almost afraid to touch her, and even Chizuko told him to keep his distance. But, in time, he got the hang of it&#x2013;support the neck, watch the soft spot on top of the head. The first and only time he gave Mari a bath, he noticed a dark-blue mark above her buttocks and thought he had done something wrong. "Masao-san, most Japanese babies have that," Chizuko said, laughing. Later Tug's wife, Lil, explained that doctors called it a Mongolian spot, which seemed like a fancy term for a temporary birthmark on a baby's behind.<br><br>Tug stopped the car at another light, and Mas noticed another one of the community gardens. This one was a triangle of green trapped next to a fancy white store that looked like it sold overpriced basketball shoes and jerseys. Mas could make out a Japanese cedar, and even some kind of makeshift pond. It was still cold in New York, a good thirty degrees lower than L.A. Were the people of New York City so hungry for trees and flowers that they had to create this spring oasis in the middle of melting snow?<br><br>Tug seemed to read Mas's mind. "Lloyd was telling me about that place. Even has a name, Teddy Bear Garden, or something like that."<br><br>Teddy bear? Kids' stuff, thought Mas.<br><br>"A developer was going to get rid of the garden, so the whole community, even Lloyd and Mari, protested. Early on, somebody had thrown a teddy bear into the area, so I guess the name stuck. You know about these community gardens, Mas. There's one across the freeway from Dodger Stadium, I think."<br><br>Tug was a die-hard Dodger fan, so it was no wonder that anything remotely involving his baseball team would stick in his mind. Mas himself recollected seeing the small clumps of flowers and vegetables against a hill right above one of the tunnels of the Pasadena Freeway. And there was another garden in Alhambra, a few towns south of Altadena, where Chinese immigrants dressed in cotton pants and sometimes straw hats tended stalks of corn and vines of cherry tomatoes. But those gardens were primarily vegetables, while these ones on Flatbush Avenue were filled with trees and flowers struggling to bloom. In L.A., everybody had pride of ownership in their personal flower gardens&#x2013;a concept that had led Mas and several thousands of other Japanese Americans to get jobs as gardeners, whether they could actually grow anything or not. Everyone assumed that Japanese had green thumbs. If only they knew the truth: that most of them starting out could hardly tell the difference between a weed and an impatiens plant. But they had caught on fast enough, making money to feed their families and send their kids to fancy schools as far away as New York.<br><br>"How long youzu gonna stay?" Mas asked.<br><br>"Well, Joy's exhibition opens in a couple of weeks. You, Mari, and Lloyd are all invited, you know. I don't know about the baby, though. I don't know what people do at art gallery openings."<br><br>Tug's daughter, Joy, had recently traded in her white coat and stethoscope for poverty and paintbrushes. It had been a bad blow, but in typical Yamada fashion, Tug had bounced back, in full support of his daughter's new career. Mas had never been much into support; at least that's what both Chizuko and Mari told him time and time again. That's why he had been surprised to hear Mari's quavering voice on the other end of the line from Brooklyn: "We're in a bit of trouble, Dad. We might need your help." Help? When had Mari ever asked for help? Mari didn't want to get into the details but told him that she and her new husband, Lloyd, were going to buy him an airplane ticket. "You'll need a driver's license to board. And don't forget a credit card, just in case," she said.<br><br>But there was one problem: Mas didn't have a credit card. He'd had one briefly, when his wife, Chizuko, was alive, but that had been about fifteen years ago. So he went to the bank, and within a week, he had his own shiny piece of plastic bearing on it his full name, masao arai.<br><br>Now, with his driver's license and new credit card in his worn leather wallet, he had both an identity and money. He wasn't sure whether they were enough to help Mari, but he knew if he didn't come through this time, he probably would never get the chance again.<br>They passed a few more corner pizza shops, a line of leafless trees in a brown park, and some small grocery stores that looked like the old produce stands in Little Tokyo. Tug finally turned right onto a smaller avenue called Carlton. On both sides of the street were three-story brick buildings&#x2013;brownstones, Tug had called them. They all had heavy metal gates on the doors, but no Armed Response signs. These Brooklyn people chose to fight their crime the old-fashioned way, thought Mas.<br><br>Cars were parked bumper to bumper along the curb, so Tug double-parked in front of one of the brownstones, pressing down a button to open the trunk. "I'm sorry I can't wait with you," Tug said. <br><br>He left the car running while he got out and lifted Mas's hard plastic yellow Samsonite suitcase from the trunk. Mas clenched his arthritic hands as he waited out on the curb in the cold.<br><br>Tug handed Mas the suitcase and a set of keys. "Lloyd asked me to give these to you. One's for the gate and the other's for the door. He'll come home right after work."<br><br>And Mari, what about her? Before Mas could get any more information, Tug was back at the driver's-side door. "See you, old man. I'll call you tomorrow."<br><br>Mas hesitated for a moment in front of the brownstone. Clutching his suitcase and keys, he started up the concrete steps, only to have Tug honk his car horn. Shaking his head of white hair back and forth, Tug lowered the passenger's-side window. "No, Mas," he said, "not up there. Down."<br><br>Mas pointed to a gate on the right that seemed to submerge below street level, and Tug nodded in response. With that, the white rental disappeared down Carlton Avenue, leaving only a brief trail of steam and exhaust.<br><br>This was worse than Mas had imagined. He knew making ends meet for a freelance filmmaker and&#x2013;could he even say it&#x2013;modern-day gardener in New York must be tough, but was it tough enough that they had to live underground? Even the small window, no higher than Mas's knees from the street, was heavily barred. You couldn't tell if it was meant to keep people out or keep people in.<br><br>Trying the keys a couple of times, Mas was finally able to open the gate. Beyond the gate was a dark and damp entryway leading to a large door. Mas's eyes had trouble adjusting to the dim light, so he pulled out his new Rite Aid reading glasses from his shirt pocket to pick out the key for the door.<br><br>The apartment was cool and musty, much like his garage after a winter rain. There were layers of smells: the familiar staleness of old newspapers and books, a lingering memory of meals made by Mari and Lloyd, and maybe decades of households before them, and a faint sweetness of talcum powder. Mas felt the side of the wall by the door&#x2013;wood paneling, but no light switch. He could make out the outline of a lamp shade, found the knob, and turned it two times.<br><br>The front room was small, about fifteen feet by fifteen feet. There was a long couch along the wall on the left side, but what caught Mas's eye first was a set of wooden stairs that led not to a door or room but to another wall. Stairs that went nowhere, an underground apartment&#x2013;what was this house? Tug had explained that the neighborhood was called Park Slope, but Mas hadn't seen any sign of anything green other than the Teddy Bear Garden. He noticed that unlike in typical Japanese American households, no shoes were left anywhere near the doorway, so he went ahead and stepped onto the hardwood floors, leaving his suitcase on the threadbare brown rug.<br><br>There was a mini kitchen in the corner, a wire dish rack holding a couple of coffee cups, a plate, and a few upside-down baby bottles. A desk by the hollow fireplace was overburdened by papers and books&#x2013;it seemed almost as if it were spitting out and rejecting the weight of the information it carried. Mas turned on another lamp by the desk and peered at the books. Most were in English, but a couple were in Japanese. A Japanese-English dictionary, the fat kind that Chizuko had used when she was writing official letters, sat on a shelf. Even though Mas and Chizuko had sent their daughter to Japanese school every Saturday, Mari wouldn't have anything to do with the language and had forgotten the little that she had learned. Chizuko was offended and sometimes hurt when the teenage Mari had hissed at her in public places: "Speak English, Mom, speak English."<br><br>These couldn't be Mari's books: but then again, who else's would they be? The son-in-law's?<br><br>On the shelf next to the dictionary were a couple of photographs: the same one of the baby Takeo that Mari had sent to Mas, and a large one of Mari with her pale and scraggly husband, Lloyd, standing on some cement stairs leading to an official government building. Mas had not seen Lloyd for years, and that absence hadn't done Lloyd any good. Instead of looking more refined and clean-cut, his hair was down to his shoulders and barely combed. He wore wire-rimmed glasses and a tan suit, but he wasn't fooling anyone. He was a no-good gardener, just like Mas. But while Mas was a Kibei, Lloyd was a hakujin man, over six feet tall. He had absolutely no excuse for falling into the same line of work as desperate men.<br><br>Taped to the wall over the desk was a grainy photocopy of a man's image. Mas adjusted his Rite Aid glasses. A Japanese man wearing a straw hat and suit. A shadow fell on half the man's face, but he looked important. Erai: a big-boss type. The image was black-and-white and had obviously been taken more than half a century ago, maybe in the 1920s or 1930s, about the time Mas was born.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Where or When</h2><p>When two lovers meet again after thirty-one years of separation, they renew their attraction and grapple with the issues of aging, erotic love, and betrayal</p><p>7 1-hour cassettesAnita Shreve teaches writing at Amherst College.

The Poms discovered what Australians were really like; the Australians discovered what the Poms were really like; and the English language suffered an assault from which it has never fully recovered. For over ten years the readers of &#39;Private Eye&#39; followed the exploits of Australia&#39;s favourite son with bated breath and Bazza became an international cult figure. Constantly eager to sink a few swift ones, as well as to find a Sheila who bangs like a shithouse door, Barry was forever likely to discover at the crucial moment that the ice-cold Foster&#39;s had gone straight to the old feller and that he was bursting to point Percy at the porcelain or even to indulge in a technicolour yawn. Barry&#39;s exploits were published in three separate books (the third of which contained episodes so shocking that &#39;Private Eye&#39; refused to print them), long since out of print. He also became the hero of two films.

Reprint. 12,500 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Doris Betts is Alumni Distinguished Professor of English at the University of North Carolina.The first novel by Betts (Heading West, 1981) in over ten years indulges in the clich&#x201a;s of domestic melodrama--a divorced couple, the illness of their only child, the burden and joy of non- nuclear families--but it's all done in an inviting Southern voice. Unfortunately, Betts has long been outclassed by those who followed her earlier example: Lee Smith, Marianne Gingher, and Kaye Gibbons, to name a few. Mary Thompson, the clever and sharp-witted daughter of a highway patrolman in North Carolina, is the latest in a long line of spunky fictional Southern girls. Full of yearning for the mother who ran off when she was ten, Mary develops an obsession with horses. Her stoical dad, Frank, has no idea how to raise a girl but is full of good intentions. When Mary is diagnosed with chronic renal failure, Frank's life also takes a turn for the worse. He can't commit to either of the women in his life--a local journalist or Mary's riding instructor--and finds matters further complicated by the return of his ex, a vain beauty whose selfishness has tragic consequences and whose entire family is considered trashy by Frank's supportive, devout mother and his sarcastic father. Dialysis stunts Mary's development into womanhood and makes her an impatient candidate for a transplant. While her grandparents bury all their long-nurtured grudges, her mother--the ideal donor- -disappears with her new, young husband. The teary denouement comes after a blow-by-blow narrative of Mary's illness. In her effort to survey the range of human reactions to the suffering of others, Betts relies on too many pointless subplots that just wander into oblivion and fantasy. She also suffers from a penchant for puns and one-liners, putting words in her protagonists mouths that are inappropriately out of character. Still, guaranteed to exercise the tear ducts. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

How much influence does it have? Despite predictions of its decline, religion has resurged in political influence across the globe, helped by the very forces that were supposed to bury it: democracy, globalization, and technology. And despite recent claims that religion is exclusively irrational and violent, its political influence is in fact diverse, sometimes promoting civil war and terrorism but at other times fostering democracy, reconciliation, and peace. Looking across the globe, the authors explain what generates these radically divergent behaviors. In a time when the public discussion of religion is overheated, these dynamic young scholars use deeply original analysis and sharp case studies to show us both how and why religion&#x2019;s influence on global politics is surging. Finally they offer concrete suggestions on how to both confront the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities posed by globally resurgent religion. 10 black-and-white illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Monica Duffy Toft</strong> is associate professor of public policy and director of the Initiative on Religion in International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School of Government.</p><p><strong>Daniel Philpott</strong> is associate professor of political science and peace studies, University of Notre Dame.</p><p><strong>Timothy Samuel Shah</strong> is Associate Director of the Religious Freedom Project at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, and Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Government at Georgetown University.</p>This books claim is that the twenty-first century is Gods Century. The term is a convenient way to capture religions effect on politics; the focus is global and encompasses all major religions. The authors favorite phrase throughout is religious actors, which include individuals or groups that have political pursuits alongside their religious beliefs and practices. Al-Qaeda, the Catholic Church, the National Association of Evangelicalsall are religious actors. The authors have observed a significant rise in the role of religion in global politics and are convinced that the trend will continue. Early chapters cover background matters, like the politics of religion, to help the uninitiated comprehend the basic issues. The core sections are devoted to focused areas, like democratization. There are also chapters covering religious civil wars, terrorism, and the push for peace and justice. Breaking up the text are tables or charts illustrating in a user-friendly way events or trends taking place.The book is filled with enough details and examples to satisfy serious researchers; appended are a 14-page bibliography and ample endnotes. A solid fit for academic collections and sizable public libraries. --Wade Osburn</p><h2>Wolves in the Land of Salmon</h2><p><p>Long considered an icon of the wild, wolves capture our imagination and spark controversy. Humans are the adult wolf&#x2019;s only true natural predator; its return to the old-growth forests and wild coastlines of the Pacific Northwest renews age-old questions about the value of wildlands and wildlife.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br> As the vivid stories unfold in this riveting and timely book, wolves emerge as smart, complex players uniquely adapted to the vast interdependent ecosystem of this stunning region. Observing them at close range, David Moskowitz explores how they live, hunt, and communicate, tracing their biology and ecology through firsthand encounters in the wildlands of the Northwest. In the process he challenges assumptions about their role and the impact of even well-meaning human interventions.</p></p><p>&#x201c;In this book, you feel the presence of wolves the same way people who knew the forests felt it in centuries past: through signs so subtle that most of us would miss them. As an expert tracker of wild animals, David Moskowitz enjoys a unique perspective, and here he shares it with us. He makes the rarely seen Northwestern wolf real in a way that no mere recounting of scientific findings could do.&#x201d; &#x2014;Daniel Mathews, author of <i>Cascade-Olympic Natural History</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dave Moskowitz has written a captivating, comprehensive, fair, and accurate portrait of one of the most magical yet most misunderstood species on the planet.

When American officials decided the prisoners were attempting to send signals, they set in motion a daring plan to rescue the more than sixty airmen thought to be held captive.<br>On November 20, a joint group of volunteers from U.S. Army Green Berets and U.S. Air Force Special Operations Forces perfectly executed the raid, only to find the prisoners' quarters empty; the POWs had been moved to a different location. Initially, the Son Tay raid was a devastating disappointment to the men who risked their lives to carry it out. Many vocal critics labeled it as a spectacular failure of our nation&#x2019;s intelligence network. However, subsequent events proved that the audacity of the rescue attempt stunned the North Vietnamese, who implemented immediate changes in the treatment of their captives. The operation also restored the prisoners&#x2019; faith that their nation had not forgotten them.<br>John Gargus not only participated in the planning phase of the Son Tay rescue, but also flew as a lead navigator for the strike force. This revised edition incorporates the most recent information from raid participants and also includes recent translations of North Vietnamese perspectives. No previous account of this top-secret action has given such a full account or such insight into both the execution and the aftermath of Son Tay.<p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>JOHN GARGUS retired in 1983 from a twenty-seven-year career in the U.S. Air Force.

Some have cited a perception that began to grow after September 11: that faith in general is a source of aggression, intolerance and divisiveness--something bad for society. But how accurate is that view? And does it apply equally to all faiths? In these troubled times, we risk basing decisions of real and dangerous consequence on mistaken understandings of the faiths subscribed around us, in our immediate community as well as globally. And so, with her deep learning and sympathetic understanding, Karen Armstrong examines the impulse toward violence in each of the world's great religions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The comparative approach is new: while there have been plenty of books on jihad or the Crusades, this book lays the Christian and the Islamic way of war side by side, along with those of Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Daoism and Judaism. Each of these faiths arose in agrarian societies with plenty of motivation for violence: landowners had to lord it over peasants and warfare was essential to increase one's landholdings, the only real source of wealth before the great age of trade and commerce. In each context, it fell to the priestly class to legitimize the actions of the state. And so the martial ethos became bound up with the sacred. At the same time, however, their ideologies developed that ran counter to the warrior code: around sages, prophets and mystics. Within each tradition there grew up communities that represented a protest against the injustice and violence endemic to agrarian society. This book explores the symbiosis of these 2 impulses and its development as these confessional faiths came of age. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggression of secularism has often damaged religion and pushed it into a violent mode. But modernity has also been spectacularly violent, and so Armstrong goes on to show how and in what measure religions, in their relative maturity, came to absorb modern belligerence--and what hope there might be for peace among believers in our time.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2014:</strong> Does religion lead to violence? This is the question that Karen Armstrong, the erudite former nun, asks in <i>Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence</i>. Her answer is &#x201c;no&#x201d;&#x2014;or more specifically, that religion is not itself a source of violence and the problem lies more deeply in &#x201c;our human nature and the nature of the state.&#x201d; To prove her point, she covers roughly five thousand years of religious history, from Gilgamesh to the present day. Along the way, she builds the case against those who state, often without much context, that &#x201c;religion has been the cause of all the major wars in history.&#x201d; This is both an apologia and a wide-ranging and very readable lesson in the history of religion. It may not completely change the mind of everyone who reads it; but like everything Armstrong writes, it will leave them more enriched. <i>&#x2013;Chris Schluep</i></p>KAREN ARMSTRONG is the author of numerous other books on religious affairs, including <i>The Case for God</i>, <i>A History of God</i>, <i>The Battle for God, Holy War, Islam, Buddha</i> and <i>The Great Transformation</i>--and a memoir, <i>The Spiral Staircase</i>.

After the reduction of Metz, the story ends on December 18, 1944, when the Third Army was diverted to move against the German winter counteroffensive in the Ardennes. A parallel account from the enemy side puts the American operations in proper perspective. The volume contains also an analytical description of the decisions of commanders at army, corps, and division levels that provided the framework of the tactical operations.

Certainly I was.<br><br>The discussion began with her saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s funny the way all Americans believe they are descended from royalty.&#x201d;<br></p><p>We&#x2014;my husband, John, and I&#x2014;denied this with some indignation. We were visiting the French friend, Simone Ward, and her American husband, Stuart, a retired army colonel, whom we&#x2019;d met a few years before on the ski slopes of Courchevel; they ordinarily lived in Virginia, and we saw one another only when we were all in France because our American lives were geographically too far apart. The winter before we had discussed a summer plan: we would be traveling to Italy in August, and Simone and Stuart had invited us to stay a day or two on our way.</p><p>Together with American friends of theirs, they were renting a beautiful, big house from a cousin of Simone&#x2019;s&#x2014;an expensive house, but they were dividing the rent among four couples. We had been interested when Simone told us who these other tenants were&#x2014;retired military men, old classmates or companions-in-arms of her husband, Stuart. So that&#x2019;s how we had found ourselves surprisingly flung among a gaggle of American army generals in the south of France.</p><p>It isn&#x2019;t every day you meet generals&#x2014;after all, they inhabit another world, inside their bases or stationed overseas. Our own stations in life (doctor, writer) had not brought us into contact with many generals, and never in their military capacity, though we had known a few in the social world: There was Davis B., the husband of my friend Marjorie, whom we met during his retirement, when he opened an antiques business. And my old friend C. is the daughter of a Marine Corps general&#x2014;an old, senile gentleman when I last saw him, though in his vigorous younger days a fierce Korean War leader.</p><p>I also had some childhood memories, on account of having grown up near a minor army post, the Rock Island Arsenal, on a clump of land right in the middle of the Mississippi River, the site of the golf course where my parents played (and an emplacement of slot machines, which were illegal on either shore of the river, that is, in both Illinois and Iowa), an armory, a museum, and neat lines of the graves of Confederate men imprisoned here by the Union army during the Civil War.</p><p>John and I live in France now a lot of the time, in Paris, along with thousands of other Americans. He is a professor of medicine with a role in the control of worldwide tuberculosis and other lung diseases, in an organization whose seat is in Paris. Of course we&#x2019;re delighted to live in a pleasant place like Paris, but explaining why you live abroad is always tricky. The one thing you, we, Americans, are not allowed to say is that there is somewhere better than America to live. This is an unspeakable apostasy, even though anyone who has lived in one of the better places knows it&#x2019;s true.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not speaking of morally better, not speaking about virtue, but about livability in the sense that American magazines track the best places, from the points of view of public transport, crime, museums and hospitals and schools and so on. We mustn&#x2019;t say it, but I have noticed that more and more Americans like us are living Elsewhere if they have a good excuse, and this was something inconceivable only a few years ago. Then, you got hardship pay for living Elsewhere.</p><p>In my case, living abroad was by accident, John&#x2019;s job. Yet I became aware that he and I were inadvertently part of a historical trend: Americans didn&#x2019;t stop moving once they got to the West Coast, but have moved on, sometimes up to Alaska, sometimes back to roots in the Old World, recapturing the vanished days. More than fifty thousand Americans live in Paris alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We&#x2019;d arrived in Saint-Pantalï¿½on in September. We were in the south of France&#x2014;was this called the Lot? The Luberon? The region everyone was said to love that to us looked too much like California to be exotic. Even the fire-blighted fields were familiar.</p><p>The driveway was long, lined with stiff narrow trees like the Corot painting I remembered on the cover of my second-grade reader. With Venus de Milo on the crayon box, our distant European connections were always before American children, no invocations of Mexico or Cairo back then, except on the packages of Camel cigarettes our mothers smoked.</p><p>At the end of the driveway was a gravel turnaround, and beyond that, open gates into a courtyard. At the opposite side of the courtyard, a large house, in what in California we would call the Spanish style, with a tile roof and a vine-covered stucco wall. Several cars were parked at the edges of the turnaround, and a man stood at the gate, hands in his pockets, smiling at us in a welcoming way, then strolling toward us. It was easy to guess he was one of the generals Simone and Stuart were sharing the house with. He was not wearing a uniform, but his close haircut, the compact fitness of his erect though rather short figure, and the starched perfection of his shirt, as if he traveled with a batman, revealed his identity all the same.</p><p>&#x201c;You must be Simone&#x2019;s visitors,&#x201d; he said to us, opening the car door for me. &#x201c;Bill Baum.&#x201d; His charm was palpable even in these few words, a handsome, smiling man whose air of authority left no doubt that I would be getting out of the car as his gesture required.</p><p>We introduced ourselves to General Baum, and embraced Simone, who came flying out of the house. The two men carried into the kitchen two cases of wine we had brought, and I followed with a flat of vegetables from a roadside stand that had remained somehow unburned in a swath of singed shrubbery. In the kitchen we met Mrs. Baum, Cynthia, wearing a scarf over her hair, cooking something that smelled delicious. She waved her wooden spoon at us with a conspiratorial, welcoming grin, the complicity and sociability of cooks. The aroma of beef and carrots proclaimed some sort of Provenï¿½ale triumph for dinner. The impression of complete domestic perfection was heightened by meeting Sally Rolfe, the other general&#x2019;s wife, coming in from the market with her arms full of gladioli and daylilies.</p><p>Both of these women were beautiful, I noted, still beautiful women in their sixties, slender and straight, each with a variation of blond hair shading to decorous gray. Obviously they had been assets to their husbands; perhaps it&#x2019;s indispensable, for becoming a general, to have a beautiful wife. Their slenderness bespoke military self-discipline; both Sally Rolfe and Cynthia Baum had the figures of girls.</p><p>Our friend Simone&#x2019;s husband, Stuart Ward, was retired with the rank of colonel because of illness before he could go any higher, a lymphoma that he had since been cured of; but because he was charming and clever, he and Simone had remained friendly with all the people they had started out with when the men were lieutenants at West Point, or captains together in France in the Second World War, or perhaps Stuart had served under them, for they were older than he. Also, Simone and Stuart were known by others to have some money, and some property, and some beautiful furniture from Simone&#x2019;s side of the family&#x2014;things to sustain them at the social level their eventual rank would have predicted, but for the illness, which could happen to anyone.</p><p>Simone and Stuart had borne with dignity the disappointment of Stuart&#x2019;s career, perhaps didn&#x2019;t even feel it, for it was fate that had dealt it to them, and fate sometimes inflicts a merciful freedom from self-blame along with its blows. They didn&#x2019;t have to bear the harder sting of Stuart&#x2019;s having made some personal error or having a defect of character.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We were led out onto the porches, where the rest of the party was lying by the pool. Out of earshot, Simone rolled her eyes and said to us in a low voice, &#x201c;Thank God you&#x2019;re here. Diversion, dilution.&#x201d; Only then did we notice that she seemed agitated and tense. Simone is a tall, elegant woman but now with this hint of distress. She smiled enormously at her friends, but we sensed a strain at the edge of her teeth, perhaps the normal strain of anyone who has eight houseguests.</p><p><br><br></p><p>The Lees rose to say hello&#x2014;tan and lean people a little younger than the others: Lynne and Willard. Willard Lee, like our host, Stuart Ward, was a colonel, or, one should say, only a colonel. Poor Stuart, reddened in the sun, looked wan&#x2014;he had slowed since we last saw him, and perhaps it was his health that was making Simone tense, or the reminder that if it hadn&#x2019;t been for his health he too would be a general.</p><p>I have changed the names of these military people. What if someone reads this whose son had served with them, or who had himself served under them, looked up to and been led by them? People believe in generals, after all. Military figures like Lord Nelson and the Duke of Wellington, or George Washington and Ike, were fathers to their men.</p><p>We were installed in pretty rooms in the guesthouse on the other side of the pool. The place looked like nothing so much as the Hotel Bel Air, and I had to remind myself that things in California are often modeled after Provence, not the other way round. We unpacked only a little, as our stay would be short. &#x201c;It looks like Willard Lee is wearing tennis shorts,&#x201d; John said delightedly, for he is like a hunter, predatory about possible tennis players, elated to spot one. We expected a pleasant day.</p><p>Almost immediately, John was taken off to play singles with Willard Lee, and I sat down with the ladies by the pool. I was something of a curiosity&#x2014;they did not know any writers of fiction, and I became aware that Simone had probably exalted my accomplishments beyond what they deserved. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just incredibly interesting,&#x201d; said Sally Rolfe. &#x201c;Wherever do you get your ideas from?&#x201d; She had a Southern accent, one of the Carolinas. So did the other general&#x2019;s wife, Mrs. Baum (Cynthia). The aroma of Cynthia&#x2019;s stew trailed into the garden, seductive and deep in the hot afternoon. Exhaled phrases of satisfaction: dinner would be early, and early to bed&#x2014; this was the simple, healthy life, how they all would have liked to live in France, as well as in America, God bless it.</p><p>I had to answer any number of questions&#x2014;whether I use a pen or pencil or computer, and how long it takes to write a novel. Despite myself, despite the banality of the questions and the dozens of times I have answered them, I began to feel fascinating. I saw it was the arts of Mrs. Baum and Mrs. Rolfe that conferred this feeling. Like geishas they worked me, John too, when he got back from tennis, asking him about the health of the world and his role in it. Only Lynne Lee (husband just a colonel) betrayed a little prickle of competitive edge when it came to my writing. &#x201c;Are you published?&#x201d; she would say, or &#x201c;Are your books for adults?&#x201d; It was the dark side of military strategy I was seeing. Cynthia Baum and Sally Rolfe had excelled at concealing what Lynne Lee more clumsily revealed, the vigilant combativeness, the alert defense; their smooth tactical tact disguising a war machine directed at victory for their husbands.</p><p>I had two Siamese cats once who worked in a pair, attacking marauders. Together they jumped, hissing and screaming, onto the back of a puppy we brought home. Years before, they had jumped onto the naked back of a lover (it was John, but they didn&#x2019;t know him then), mistaking his embrace for aggression. I thought of those cats because one of them was named Cynthia. These ladies did not claw the handsome John&#x2019;s back when he and Willard came in from their tennis (Willard having won); they purred delightfully at him.</p><p>Our friend Simone busied herself carrying trays of drinks in and out, stringing the beans, folding the serviettes from the dryer. There was something taciturn and self-sacrificing in her manner, like Martha to the brace of brilliant Marys. Even Cynthia Baum, charged with the dinner&#x2014;they were taking turns cooking&#x2014;went at it in the manner of the sprightlier biblical figure, while our poor friend Simone, usually animated, bridge playing, chattering, and fully armed, was now preoccupied, even depressed. I thought she was perhaps worried about Stuart&#x2019;s health, for he seemed weak. It could not be that the contrast of his pallor with the vigor of the others was newly getting her down, because they were all old friends and saw one another constantly back in Virginia.</p><p>Also, she herself had fully developed general&#x2019;s-wife killer instincts; it was a pity she hadn&#x2019;t been able to use them like these other women, real generals&#x2019; wives. In Saint-Pantalï¿½on, I could see that Simone&#x2019;s skills, Frenchwoman though she was&#x2014;that is to say, full of rigor and wiles&#x2014;were underdeveloped compared to those of women who had spent decades as the wives of successful generals. Sally Rolfe and Cynthia Baum&#x2014;even Lynne Lee&#x2014; could not come up to them; her passionate resentment, the flavor of her disappointment, husband just a colonel, were too palpable. </p><p>&#x201c;I could never write a book. How marvelous for you,&#x201d; Lynne was saying. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m absolutely too damn stupid and that&#x2019;s a fact,&#x201d; which seemed to mean: stupidity is exactly what&#x2019;s needed for book writing, bitch, and fortunately I&#x2019;m too smart for that.</p><p>&#x201c;I see that Willard and your husband are back. It looks like Willard won. I can always tell from the way he walks. I tell him he has to let other people beat him once in a while so they&#x2019;ll keep playing with him,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>John and Willard Lee went to shower. We ladies swam, then went with the generals into the village to look at the church. When I came out from showering and changing at dinnertime, Simone was bringing drinks onto the patio&#x2014;whatever these are called in France, I suppose&nbsp;terrasses. I helped her with the trolley of glasses while she filled the ice bucket. When she came out of the kitchen, where Cynthia Baum was putting the finishing touches on the dinner, she was literally grinding her teeth.</p><p>&#x201c;The Cuisine Derby&#x201d; was her only remark.</p><p>Then the interesting cuisine. The food was evolved to an obsessive pitch; luckily, the haricots verts we had brought were harmonious with Cynthia&#x2019;s perfect&nbsp;navarin. The company was convivial and relaxed by the end of dinner, and sat up late talking or, rather, listening to a discussion of history&#x2014;all except Stuart, who went to bed before ten.</p><p>The topic of historical memory came up after the excellent dinner, when we&#x2019;d gathered on the patio and the American army general Rolfe was telling about his French ancestors. His colleague, Bill Baum, was in Europe to look up his roots in Germany. The Baums and Rolfes were both retired and had the luxury of time for genealogical research.</p><p>&#x201c;Some of my forebears were Huguenots from around La Rochelle,&#x201d; Rolfe was saying, &#x201c;but some were Catholics fleeing before the Revolution.

His first Rebus novel was published in 1987, and the Rebus books are now translated into twenty-two languages and are bestsellers on several continents. Ian Rankin has been elected a Hawthornden Fellow, and is also a past winner of the Chandler-Fulbright Award. He is the recipient of four Crime Writers&#39; Association Dagger Awards including the prestigious Diamond Dagger in 2005. In 2004, Ian won America&#39;s celebrated Edgar Award for &#39;Resurrection Men&#39;. He has also been shortlisted for the Edgar and Anthony Awards in the USA, and won Denmark&#39;s Palle Rosenkrantz Prize, the French Grand Prix du Roman Noir and the Deutscher Krimipreis. Ian Rankin is also the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews and Edinburgh. A contributor to BBC2&#39;s &#39;Newsnight Review&#39;, he also presented his own TV series, &#39;Ian Rankin&#39;s Evil Thoughts&#39;. He recently received the OBE for services to literature, opting to receive the prize in his home city of Edinburgh, where he lives with his partner and two sons.If you've been yearning for a fast-paced story coupled with a crisp read, your hunt is over. In this departure from Rankin's usual John Rebus mysteries, ex-SAS operative Gordon Reeve (a killer in one of the Inspector Rebus books) transports himself to San Diego when he learns his estranged brother has committed suicide there. It soon becomes evident that his brother's death was not self-inflicted. As Reeve identifies the motive and hunts down the killers, Christian Rodska delivers a notable performance as the tough Briton. His rich, sometimes gravelly voice is always in command. He also handles the varied characters expertly.

In this lively account of one season, he introduces us to the tightly knit world of a fire crew, to the complex geography of the North Rim, to the technique and changing philosophy of fire management. Firefighters, the migrant workers of the National Park Service, look askance at its career employees, we're told: Park Naturalists are "fern feelers" and Rangers are simply police officers. Pyne makes trenchant comments about the Park Service and its emphasis on people rather than resource management; as more visitors come into an area, Rangers replace fire crews. A firefighter needs resourcefulness and stamina, writes Pyne, and these qualities are amply represented in his tales of men in the field, forest and on the Rim. The book will appeal to readers who enjoy action; it will also appeal to those interested in the human-wildfire-nature relationship. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Midnight Falcon (The Rigante Series, Book 2)</h2><p>Bane the Bastard is the illegitimate son of the Rigante king who men called Demonblade. Born of treachery, Bane grew up an outcast in his own land, feared by his fellow highlanders, and denied by the father whose unmistakable mark he bore&#x2013;the eyes of Connavar, one tawny brown, the other emerald green.<br><br>Hounded from the country of his birth, Bane found acceptance across the seas&#x2013;only to have it stripped away in an instant by a cruel and deadly swordsman. Now fighting as a gladiator in the blood-soaked arenas of the Empire, Bane lives for one thing: revenge. And he pursues his goal with the same single-minded determination that won his father a crown.<br><br>But more is at stake than a young warrior&#x2019;s quest for vengeance. The armies of the Stone are preparing to march on the lands of the Rigante. The fate of human and Seidh alike will be decided by the clash of swords&#x2013;and by the bonds of twisted love and bitterness between a father and a son . . .<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Following <i>Sword in the Storm</i>, <i>Midnight Falcon</i> is David Gemmell's second novel in the Rigante sequence. This volume can stand alone, though the series will be more accessible if read in order.<p> Seventeen-year-old Bane, illegitimate son of King Connovar, comes to the city of Stone, a place of gladiatorial combat, corruption, and religious terror. Embittered by his father's refusal to acknowledge him, Bane's wildness leads to bloodshed before friendship and betrayal force him to accept the complexities of power and responsibility. The novel builds to an epic climax, as Bane must accept who he is in order to lead his people in a desperate battle for their very survival. </p><p> David Gemmell has created a detailed and realistic world in which the action is vividly described and often thrilling. Yet there is a melancholy tone, for the author is as concerned with the consequences of war and the nature of men of violence as he is with conflict itself. There is a sense of the tragedy of war, lending the sad grandeur of history to a strongly characterized and intelligent adventure. It is something the series has in common with Stephen King's haunting fantasy western epic <i>The Dark Tower</i>. <i>--Gary S.

Jeremiah is a model for us to understand the prophets of the Old Testament. But more than that, he alone of the prophets saw his relationship with God as a problem to be grappled with rather than an obligation to be taken for granted. His willingness to question and to doubt was unique and, Holladay suggests, may put him more in step with our time than his own.

He is a great thinker, an essayist, but most of all an optimist. When war arrives he is forced to reassess many of the things he had been so sure of. The war brings great change - Belgian refugees come with dreadful stories and everywhere it seems there are young men dressed in khaki. The family&#x2019;s young German tutor is forced to head back to Germany, and Mr Britling&#x2019;s seventeen year old son enlists in the Territorials. Day by day and month by month, Wells chronicles the unfolding events and public reaction as witnessed by the inhabitants of one house in rural Essex. Each of the characters tries in a different way to keep their bearings in a world suddenly changed beyond recognition. Tragedy ensues, Mr Britling must wrestle with outrage, grief and attempts at rationalisation as he &#x2018;sees it through&#x2019;.<br><br>Written in 1916, while the outcome of the war was still uncertain, this is both a fascinating portrait of Britain at war, and a chronicle of events seen from a contemporary perspective, and an insight into H G Wells himself, Mr Britling being a largely autobiographical character.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>BOOK I : MATCHING&#x2019; S EASY AT EASE <br>I.

But the local people told me that winterized cottages were few and far between. And I had certain social aspirations. There was a standard of housing that I wouldn't go beneath. I wanted the kind of place that Jack London or Jack Kerouac might have rented. It could be lacking in class, but it had to lack class in a certain kind of way. Log cabins with rusty woodstoves and squirrels in the walls were okay, but house trailers fitted out with wall-to-wall shag and motel furniture were unacceptable. If I couldn't find a place with a good view of the forest and the lake, I'd go back to the city, which right now didn't seem like such a bad idea. I hadn't written a sigle paragraph since my departure from Tower Island, and nowadays, the idea of having running hot water and a plug-in typewriter seemed as exotic as any tent camp in the wilderness.<br></p><h2>Buckminster Fuller: Anthology for the New Millennium</h2><p>Buckminster Fuller, inventor, thinker and architect, was one of the best known Americans of the twentieth century. Often compared to Leonardo da Vinci and called "the planet's friendly genius," he was the inventor of the geodesic dome, the man who coined the term "spaceship earth," and an educator without parallel. Yet, most of his books are out of print today.<br><br>To remedy this situation, his longtime friend and architectural partner, Thomas Zung, has compiled a Bucky Fuller reader. This anthology consists of chapters selected from twenty of Bucky's many books, each with a new Introduction by such notables as Arthur C. Clarke, Steve Forbes, Calvin Tomkins, Dr. Martin Meyerson, Sir Harold W. Kroto, Arthur L. Loeb, E. J. Applewhite, and others.<br><br>Altogether, this book provides an overview of a remarkable intellectual career and the best possible introduction to the man and his thought. Bucky Fuller was one of the most original thinkers and builders that America has ever produced, and this book makes his work available to a new generation at the beginning of a new millennium.<br></p><p>Great minds most certainly do not all think alike. Case in point: R. Buckminster Fuller, who revolutionized Western thinking and design, even though only a tiny fraction of his ideas were ever developed. Outrageously, most of his works are out of print here at the turn of the century, so his collaborator and architectural partner, Thomas T.K. Zung, organized the publication of <i>Buckminster Fuller: Anthology for the New Millennium</i>. Collected are 20 selections from Fuller's books, each introduced by notable thinkers and writers like Steve Forbes and Arthur C. Clarke. Though Fuller's distinctive style--part engineering text, part poetry--takes a bit of extra attention to penetrate, the rewards are tremendous. Though now clichï¿½d, his concept of Spaceship Earth ("only eight thousand miles in diameter, which is almost a negligible dimension in the great vastness of space") blew more minds than the Beatles' "White Album." Zung's selections are juicy and enticing--few readers will be able to resist a trip to the library after reading morsels of <i>Utopia or Oblivion</i> and <i>Epic Poem on the History of Industrialization</i>. The introductions range from scholarly to personal, and close in on Fuller's work and personality without ever quite reaching them-they, of course, are best revealed in his writing and his still-mimicked work. Those new to this thinker will find the anthology breathtaking, while those in the know will discover much that is new, including his amazing $10 telegram version of the theory of relativity. It's hard to overestimate Fuller's importance to 20th- and 21st-century thought, despite his self-description in his last book: "I am now close to 88 and I am confident that the only thing important about me is that I am an average healthy human." If only he knew. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Thomas Tse Kwai Zung</b> was born in Shanghai, China. He was a student of Buckminster Fuller and, with Fuller's Synergistics, Inc., designed the elongated geodesic dome in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1968. He has worked on various geodesic domes, including the <i>Jitterbug</i> sculpture, Tensegrities, the Fly Eye's dome, and Fuller's last invention, the Hang-It-All. Zung is president of Buckminster Fuller, Sadao and Zung, and also serves as a board member of the Buckminster Fuller institute.<br></p><h2>Rise &amp; Fall of the Nazis</h2><p>The Nazis unleashed a war on the world which resulted in the deaths of countless millions. During the twelve years which the Third Reich lasted, they wreaked devastation on an unprecedented scale, including the genocidal mass murder of civilians. But where did their murderous ideology come from, and how did they seize power? Defeated in the First World War, Germany was humiliated by the Treaty of Versailles, forced to pay ruinous reparations and deprived of large tracts of land. When the fragile Weimar Republic was plunged into chaos and hyperinflation by the worldwide Great Depression, Hitler exploited fears of communism to have himself appointed Chancellor in 1933, before assuming sole executive power as Fuhrer shortly afterwards.Fascinating photographs reveal key events in the Nazis&#39; rise and fall: from Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass, in 1938, during which synagogues were burned, businesses wrecked and thousands of Jews sent to concentration camps, to the Blitzkrieg which quickly overran most of Europe; from the Battle of Britain in the west to the Holocaust and total war on the Eastern Front; and, from the 1944 D-Day landings on the coast of Normandy to the last days of the Reich in the ruins of Berlin.</p><p>Claire Welch</p><h2>National Geographic&#39;s Guide to Small Town Escapes</h2><p><p> <i>America's most enticing small towns promise idyllic getaways in places that time forgot -- from colonial villages to Old West towns to sunny pueblos to salt-sprayed fishing hamlets.</i> </p><p> </p><ul> <li>Plan the perfect escape in 77 of America's best small towns, where you can visit antique shops or museums, take a hike, go birding, savor local cuisine, sleep on a feather bed, or simply rock away the afternoon on a breezy veranda. </li><li>Descriptive essays by National Geographic travel writers capture the essence of each town. </li><li>Detailed practical information highlights inns and B&amp;Bs, restaurants, annual events, and must-see local and nearby sights. </li><li>Brilliant color photos show off the towns' unique qualities, and easy-to-use, full-color maps make finding these special places easy. </li></ul></p><p></p><h2>Cyril Connolly: Journal and Memoir</h2><p>This volume, including the journal Connolly kept from 1927 to 1938--part writer&#39;s notebook, part private reflection, and part gossip--gives an illuminating memoir of Connolly</p><p></p><h2>The Mental Floss History of the United States: The (Almost) Complete and (Entirely) Entertaining Story of America</h2><p>Smarter than your old history teacher, funnier than the founding fathers, and more American than apple pie,<em> The Mental Floss History of the United States</em> is an almost (but not entirely) comprehensive primer on American history (or at least, the good stuff).

Under the star-washed sky its stone walls glowed, rising up over Boonsboro&#x2019;s Square as they had for more than two centuries. Even the crossroads held quiet now, stretching out in pools of shadows and light. All the windows and storefronts along Main Street seemed to sleep, content to doze away in the balm of the summer night.</p><p>She should do the same, Hope thought. Settle down, stretch out. Sleep.</p><p>That would be the sensible thing to do, and she considered herself a sensible woman. But the long day had left her restless, and&#x2014;she reminded herself&#x2014;Carolee would arrive bright and early to start breakfast.</p><p>The innkeeper could sleep in.</p><p>In any case, it was barely midnight. When she&#x2019;d lived and worked in Georgetown, she&#x2019;d rarely managed to settle in for the night this early. Of course, then she&#x2019;d been managing the Wickham, and if she hadn&#x2019;t been dealing with some small crisis or handling a guest request, she&#x2019;d been enjoying the nightlife.</p><p>The town of Boonsboro, tucked into the foothills of Maryland&#x2019;s Blue Ridge Mountains, might have a rich and storied history, it certainly had its charms&#x2014;among which she counted the revitalized inn she now managed&#x2014;but it wasn&#x2019;t famed for its nightlife.</p><p>That would change a bit when her friend Avery opened her restaurant and tap house. And wouldn&#x2019;t it be fun to see what the energetic Avery MacTavish did with her new enterprise right next door&#x2014;and just across The Square from Avery&#x2019;s pizzeria.</p><p>Before summer ended, Avery would juggle the running of two restaurants, Hope thought.</p><p>And people called <i>her</i> an overachiever.</p><p>She looked around the kitchen&#x2014;clean, shiny, warm, and welcoming. She&#x2019;d already sliced fruit, checked the supplies, restocked the refrigerator. So everything sat ready for Carolee to prepare breakfast for the guests currently tucked in their rooms.</p><p>She&#x2019;d finished her paperwork, checked all the doors, and made her rounds checking for dishes&#x2014;or anything else out of place. Duties done, she told herself, and still she wasn&#x2019;t ready to tuck her own self in her third-floor apartment.</p><p>Instead, she poured an indulgent glass of wine and did a last circle through The Lobby, switching off the chandelier over the central table with its showy summer flowers.</p><p>She moved through the arch, gave the front door one last check before she turned toward the stairs. Her fingers trailed lightly over the iron banister.</p><p>She&#x2019;d already checked The Library, but she checked again. It wasn&#x2019;t anal, she told herself. A guest might have slipped in for a glass of Irish or a book. But the room was quiet, settled like the rest.</p><p>She glanced back. She had guests on this floor. Mr. and Mrs. Vargas&#x2014;Donna and Max&#x2014;married twenty-seven years. The night at the inn, in Nick and Nora, had been a birthday gift for Donna from their daughter. And wasn&#x2019;t that sweet?</p><p>Her other guests, a floor up in Westley and Buttercup, chose the inn for their wedding night. She liked to think the newlyweds, April and Troy, would take lovely, lasting memories with them.</p><p>She checked the door to the second-level porch, then on impulse unlocked it and stepped out into the night.</p><p>With her wine, she crossed the wide wood deck, leaned on the rail. Across The Square, the apartment above Vesta sat dark&#x2014;and empty now that Avery had moved in with Owen Montgomery. She could admit&#x2014;to herself anyway&#x2014;she missed looking over and knowing her friend was right there, just across Main.</p><p>But Avery was exactly where she belonged, Hope decided, with Owen&#x2014;her first and, as it turned out, her last boyfriend.</p><p>Talk about sweet.</p><p>And she&#x2019;d help plan a wedding&#x2014;May bride, May flowers&#x2014;right there in The Courtyard, just as Clare&#x2019;s had been this past spring.</p><p>Thinking of it, Hope looked down Main toward the bookstore. Clare&#x2019;s Turn The Page had been a risk for a young widow with two children and another on the way. But she&#x2019;d made it work. Clare had a knack for making things work. Now she was Clare Montgomery, Beckett&#x2019;s wife. And when winter came again, they&#x2019;d welcome a new baby to the mix.</p><p>Odd, wasn&#x2019;t it, that her two friends had lived right in Boonsboro for so long, and she&#x2019;d relocated only the year&#x2014;not even a full year yet&#x2014;before. The new kid in town.</p><p>Now, of the three of them, she was the only one still right here, right in the heart of town.</p><p>Silly to miss them when she saw them nearly every day, but on restless nights she could wish, just a little, they were still close.</p><p>So much had changed, for all of them, in this past year.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been perfectly content in Georgetown, with her home, her work, her routine. With Jonathan, the cheating bastard.</p><p>She&#x2019;d had good, solid plans, no rush, no hurry, but solid plans. The Wickham had been her place. She&#x2019;d known its rhythm, its tones, its needs. And she&#x2019;d done a hell of a job for the Wickhams, and their cheating bastard son, Jonathan.</p><p>She&#x2019;d planned to marry him. No, there&#x2019;d been no formal engagement, no concrete promises, but marriage and future had been on the table.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t a moron.</p><p>And all the time&#x2014;or at least in the last several months&#x2014;they&#x2019;d been together, with him sharing her bed, or her sharing his, he&#x2019;d been seeing someone else. Someone of his more elevated social strata you could say, she mused, with lingering bitterness. Someone who wouldn&#x2019;t work ten- and twelve-hour days, and often more&#x2014;to manage the exclusive hotel, but who&#x2019;d stay there, in its most elaborate suite, of course.</p><p>No, she wasn&#x2019;t a moron, but she&#x2019;d been far too trusting and humiliatingly shocked when Jonathan told her he would be announcing his engagement&#x2014;to someone else&#x2014;the next day.</p><p>Humiliatingly shocked, she thought again, particularly as they&#x2019;d been naked and in her bed at the time.</p><p>Then again, he&#x2019;d been shocked, too, when she&#x2019;d ordered him to get the hell out. He genuinely hadn&#x2019;t understood why anything between them should change.</p><p>That single moment ushered in a lot of change.</p><p>Now she was Inn BoonsBoro&#x2019;s innkeeper, living in a small town in Western Maryland, a good clip from the bright lights of the big city.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t spend what free time she had planning clever little dinner parties, or shopping in the boutiques for the perfect shoes for the perfect dress for the next event.</p><p>Did she miss all that? Her go-to boutique, her favorite lunch spot, the lovely high ceilings and flower-framed little patio of her own town house? Or the pressure and excitement of preparing the hotel for visits from dignitaries, celebrities, business moguls?</p><p>Sometimes, she admitted. But not as often as she&#x2019;d expected to, and not as much as she&#x2019;d assumed she would.</p><p>Because she had been content in her personal life, challenged in her professional one, and the Wickham had been her place. But she&#x2019;d discovered something in the last few months. Here, she wasn&#x2019;t just content, but happy. The inn wasn&#x2019;t just her place, it was <i>home</i>.</p><p>She had her friends to thank for that, and the Montgomery brothers along with their mother. Justine Montgomery had hired her on the spot. At the time Hope hadn&#x2019;t known Justine well enough to be surprised by her quick offer. But she did know herself, and continued to be surprised at her own fast, impulsive acceptance.</p><p>Zero to sixty? More like zero to ninety and still going.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t regret the impulse, the decision, the move.</p><p>Fresh starts hadn&#x2019;t been in the plan, but she was good at adjusting plans. Thanks to the Montgomerys, the lovingly&#x2014;and effortfully&#x2014;restored inn was her home and her career.</p><p>She wandered the porch, checking the hanging planters, adjusting&#x2014;minutely&#x2014;the angle of a bistro chair.</p><p>&#x201c;And I love every square inch of it,&#x201d; she murmured.</p><p>One of the porch doors leading out from Elizabeth and Darcy opened. The scent of honeysuckle drifted on the night air.</p><p>Someone else was restless, Hope thought. Then again, she didn&#x2019;t know if ghosts slept. She doubted if the spirit Beckett had named Elizabeth for the room she favored would tell her if she asked. Thus far, Lizzy hadn&#x2019;t deigned to speak to her inn-mate.</p><p>Hope smiled at the term, sipped her wine.</p><p>&#x201c;Lovely night. I was just thinking how different my life is now, and all things considered, how glad I am it is.&#x201d; She spoke in an easy, friendly way. After all, the research she and Owen had done so far on their permanent guest had proven Lizzy&#x2014;or Eliza Ford when she&#x2019;d lived&#x2014;was one of Hope&#x2019;s ancestors.</p><p>Family, to Hope&#x2019;s mind, ought to be easy and friendly.</p><p>&#x201c;We have newlyweds in W&amp;B. They look so happy, so fresh and new somehow. The couple in N&amp;N are here celebrating her fifty-eighth birthday. They don&#x2019;t look new, but they do look happy, and so nice and comfortable. I like giving them a special place to stay, a special experience. It&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m good at.&#x201d;</p><p>Silence held, but Hope could <i>feel</i> the presence. Companionable, she realized. Oddly companionable. Just a couple of women up late, looking out at the night.</p><p>&#x201c;Carolee will be here early. She&#x2019;s doing breakfast tomorrow, and I have the morning off. So.&#x201d; She lifted her glass. &#x201c;Some wine, some introspection, some feeling sorry for myself circling around to realizing I have nothing to feel sorry for myself for.&#x201d; With a smile, Hope sipped again. &#x201c;So, a good glass of wine.</p><p>&#x201c;Now that I&#x2019;ve accomplished all that, I should get to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>Still she lingered a little longer in the quiet summer night, with the scent of honeysuckle drifting around her.</p><p>WHEN HOPE CAME down in the morning, the scent was fresh coffee, grilled bacon&#x2014;and, if her nose didn&#x2019;t deceive her, Carolee&#x2019;s apple-cinnamon pancakes. She heard easy conversation in The Dining Room. Donna and Max, talking about poking around town before driving home.</p><p>Hope went down the hall, circled to the kitchen to see if Carolee needed a hand. Justine&#x2019;s sister had her bright blond hair clipped short for summer, with the addition of flirty bangs over her cheerful hazel eyes. They beamed at Hope even as she wagged a finger.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing down here, young lady?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nearly ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And your morning off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which I spent&#x2014;so far&#x2014;sleeping until eight, doing yoga, and putzing.&#x201d; She helped herself to a mug of coffee, closed her own deep brown eyes as she sipped. &#x201c;My first cup of the day. Why is it always the best?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wish I knew. I&#x2019;m still trying to switch to tea. My Darla&#x2019;s on a health kick and doing her best to drag me along.&#x201d; Carolee spoke of her daughter with affection laced with exasperation. &#x201c;I really like our Titania and Oberon blend. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s not coffee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing is but coffee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said it. She can&#x2019;t wait for the new gym to open. She says if I don&#x2019;t sign up for yoga classes, she&#x2019;s signing me up and carting me over there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll love yoga.&#x201d; Hope laughed at the doubt&#x2014;and anxiety&#x2014;on Carolee&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Honest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; Carolee lifted the dishcloth again, went back to polishing the granite countertop. &#x201c;The Vargases loved the room, and as usual the bathroom&#x2014;starring the magic toilet&#x2014;got raves. I haven&#x2019;t heard a peep out of the newlyweds yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be disappointed in them if you had.&#x201d; Hope brushed at her hair. Unlike Carolee, she was experimenting with letting it grow out of the short, sharp wedge she&#x2019;d sported the last two years. The dark, glossy ends hit her jaw now, just in between enough to be annoying.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go check on Donna and Max, see if they want anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me do it,&#x201d; Hope said. &#x201c;I want to say good morning anyway, and I think I&#x2019;ll run down to TTP, say hi to Clare while it&#x2019;s still my morning off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw her last night at the book club. She&#x2019;s got the cutest baby bump. Oh, I&#x2019;ve got plenty of batter if the newlyweds want more pancakes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let them know.&#x201d;</p><p>She slipped into The Dining Room, chatted with the guests while she subtly checked to be sure there was still plenty of fresh summer berries, coffee, juice.</p><p>Once she&#x2019;d satisfied herself her guests were happy, she started back upstairs to grab her purse&#x2014;and ran into the newlyweds as they entered from the rear porch.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, good morning.&#x201d; The new bride carried the afterglow of a honeymoon morning well spent. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the most beautiful room. I love everything about it. I felt like a princess bride.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As you wish,&#x201d; Hope said and made them both laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s so clever the way each room&#x2019;s named and decorated for romantic couples.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Couples with happy endings,&#x201d; Troy reminded her, and got a slow, dreamy smile from his bride.</p><p>&#x201c;Like us. We want to thank you so much for making our wedding night so special. It was everything I wanted. Just perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what we do here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we wondered.

We were going to drive down into Virginia, just pick our spots as we went, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we really like it right here. We&#x2019;ll take any room that&#x2019;s available, if there is one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d love to have you, and your room&#x2019;s open tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; April bounced on her toes. &#x201c;Oh, this is better than perfect. Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s our pleasure. I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re enjoying your stay.&#x201d;</p><p>Happy guests made for happy innkeepers, Hope thought as she dashed upstairs for her bag. She dashed back down again, into her office to change the reservation, and with the scents and voices behind her, hurried out the back through Reception.</p><p>She skirted the side of the building, glancing across the street at Vesta. She knew Avery&#x2019;s and Clare&#x2019;s schedules nearly as well as her own.

Garfield</h2><p>Capitol Hill veteran Kenneth Ackerman re-creates an American political landscape where fierce battles for power unfolded against a chivalrous code of honor in a country struggling to emerge from the long shadow of the Civil War. James Garfield's 1880 dark horse campaign after the longest-ever Republican nominating convention, his victory in the closest-ever popular vote for president, his struggle against bitterly feuding factions once elected, and the public's response to his assassination is the most dramatic presidential odyssey of the Gilded Age&#x2014;and among the most momentous in our nation's history. This journey through political backrooms, dazzling convention floors, and intrigue-filled congressional and White House chambers, reveals the era's decency and humanity as well as the sharp partisanship that exploded in the pistol shots of assassin Charles Guiteau, the disgruntled patronage-seeker eager to replace the elected Commander-in-Chief with one of his own choosing.</p><p>Kenneth D. Ackerman has served for more than twenty-five years in senior posts on Capitol Hill and in the Executive Branch, including as counsel to two U.S. Senate committees and as administrator of the Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency during the Clinton-Gore administration. He is the author of The Gold Ring: Jim Fisk, Jay Gould, and Black Friday 1869 and currently practices law in Washington, D.C. A chronicler of the Gilded Age, his forthcoming book for Carroll &amp; Graf will be a new biography of Boss Tweed.Several hundred pages of text on Garfield and the politics of his day may seem a stretch, given the gray, hyper-partisan, issueless politics of the Gilded Age. But in Ackerman's hands, the story of Garfield's presidency and murder comes brilliantly alive. Ackerman (an attorney who has worked on Capitol Hill and in the White House and written about Gilded Age scandals) relates with gusto and fizz the story of Garfield's unanticipated nomination as Republican presidential candidate in 1880, his election by a whisker, the travails of his few months in office, and his assassination. It's a story mostly of the struggle for spoils and patronage between two wings of the post-Civil War party of Lincoln. In fact, the lonely, unstable assassin, Charles Guiteau, was a resentful partisan of the wing that Garfield didn't fully reward. Soon after the president's death, and largely as a result, Congress enacted civil service reform. Ackerman brings to life all this and the colorful political figures, mostly senators, who strode the nation's public stage. The trouble is that, like so many works of history these days, it's long on narrative and short, very short, on analysis. You wouldn't know that the political deadlocks of the 1880s deeply, and disastrously, affected the lives of freed slaves, nor do readers learn of agricultural and labor crises, industrial growth or financial shenanigans-the very matters that factional fighting and political murder kept under the rug. It's a pity that Ackerman doesn't apply his skills to such central matters of context and significance.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Disney High School Musical: East High Yearbook (Scholastic special market editio</h2><p>A fictitious yearbook containing photographs and profiles of the characters from &#34;High School Musical&#34; including Ryan, Troy, Gabriella, Sharpay, Taylor, and Chad, and includes signed notes and messages from family and friends.</p><p></p><h2>The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook: Work</h2><p>Work is bad enough, but what if things go really wrong?

Michigan Ghost Towns compiles settlements and communities that have faded into Michigan&#39;s history and legend: &#34;&#34;Baraga County&#39;s $2,000,000 Ghost Railroad&#34;&#34; (Reprinted from the September 23, 1964 Issue of the L&#39;Anse Sentinel by permission) A few rusty nails, some old telegraph poles and a bed grown over with brush and trees in the Huron Mountain district is all that remains today of a $2,000,000 railroad which never ran a train of cars and failed to bring in a cent of revenue. For several years men labored in the wilderness to lay 35 miles of tracks through rocky gorges and swamps from the mining town of Champion (now a ghost town) to Huron Bay. At Huron Bay an immense ore dock, buildings and homes were erected in preparation for a rush of business which the promoters of the Huron Bay and Iron Range Railway thought would make them wealthy. Pequaming: One of the largest ghost towns in the Upper Peninsula with buildings still standing is Pequaming. Located about 8 miles north of L&#39;Anse, the huge smokestacks and water towers are visible from the L&#39;Anse waterfront where the remains of the once prosperous industrial town lies at the tip of a tree-covered peninsula jutting out into the Keweenaw Bay.

Thousands of tourists travel highway M-123 between Eckerman and Paradise each summer and visit the Tahquamenon Falls area, unaware that they pass near the site of this one-time lumbering and fishing village at the mouth of the Tahquamenon River where it empties into Lake Superior. What was once a road to the site is now a marsh- and weed-grown trail almost impassable by automobile.

Misty and her sister were kept as slaves on a mountain ranch and subjected to almost complete isolation, sexual abuse, and extreme physical violence. Their step-father kept a loaded rifle by the door to make sure the young girls were too terrified to try to escape. No rescue would ever come since the few people who knew they existed did not care.</p><p><strong>Sexual abuse among the Amish.</strong>&nbsp;When Misty reached her teens, her parents feared she and her sister would escape and took them to an Amish community. Devastated to again find herself in a world of fear, cruelty, and abuse, Misty was sexually assaulted by the bishop. As Misty recalls, "Amish sexual abusers are only shunned by the church for six weeks, a punishment that never seems to work....I knew I had to get help, and one freezing morning in early March, I made a dash for a tiny police station in rural Minnesota. After reporting the bishop, I left the Amish and found myself plummeted into a strange modern world with only a second-grade education and no ID or social security card."</p><p><strong>Misty has a message for abuse survivors:</strong>&nbsp;"Please be encouraged, the cycle of abuse can be broken.

He also followed his own lines of research, resulting in books such as 'Plotinus', 'Pistis Sophia' and the present work, each of them scholarly, comprehensive in scope, and eminently readable.

Some of these essays originally appeared in recent issues of <i>Social Science History</i>; the editors have added new material, along with an introduction placing each essay in the context of current debates. <br>Based on extensive archival research and detailed historical examination, this collection constitutes an important contribution to the study of an issue of enduring significance. It is sure to become a standard reference on the Atlantic slave trade for years to come.<p></p><p><i>Contributors.</i> Ralph A.

Mary Jemison was perhaps the most famous white captive who stayed to live among the Indians. Her account of her life with the Senecas--as told to upstate New York doctor James Everett Seaver in 1824--has gone through countless editions, reprints, and retellings before the creation of this definitive edition by the feminist scholar of ethnicity June Namias. In 1758, at about the age of fifteen, Mary Jemison was captured with her Scotch-Irish family in western Pennsylvania by a party of six Shawnees and four French in the Seven Years&#39; War. Her captors traded her to two Seneca sisters, who adopted her to replace a slain brother. Jemison knew that her family had been killed when she saw her mother&#39;s red-haired scalp drying over a campfire along with the scalps of her father and brothers. She herself would survive two Indian husbands (a Delaware and a Seneca), the births of eight children, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the development of the canals in western New York, to die in 1833 at about age ninety. Mary Jemison&#39;s vivid personal account of her life is full of insights into Iroquois culture. It is also a major document of acculturation and survival. Mrs. Jemison stayed with the Senecas mainly because of family ties, but she also became part of Seneca society. A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison is an example of an original American literary genre, the captivity narrative. Such wild and woolly accounts were the first westerns of the American frontier and the first national best-sellers. But Jemison&#39;s story isalso about the conflicts, complexities, and relationships among white and native cultures in early America. Her Iroquois woman&#39;s perspective on the American Revolution, and on New York in the eighteenth and the early nineteenth century, is unique among the primary sources that w</p><p>In 1758, fifteen-year-old Mary Jemison and her family were captured near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by a Shawnee and French raiding party. Shortly thereafter, her family was killed; she was turned over to a Seneca family, adopted by them, and four years later taken to their western New York homeland--where, by choice, she spent the rest of her life as an Iroquois wife, mother, and landed proprietor.James E.

Elizabeth's policy of seizing foreign assets made her popular at home but drew her into a partnership with pirates who preyed on the state's foes and friends alike, being rewarded or punished depending on how much of a cut the Queen received, rather than the legitimacy of their action.<br><p>For this reason the rule of law at sea was arbitrary and almost non-existent. Even those, such as the Lord Admiral and the Court of Admiralty, who were tasked with policing the seas and eliminating piracy, managed their own pirate fleets. While honest merchants could rail and protest, the value to the exchequer of this dubious income was enormous, often equaling, on an annual basis, the input from all other sources such as taxation or customs dues. Moreover, the practice of piracy taught English seamen how to fight and, when the nation was at its greatest peril, in 1588, it was pirates who kept the Spanish Armada away from invading the English coast.<br></p><p>Charles Howard, commander of the British forces, Richard Grenville, Walter Raleigh and Francis Drake, were all pirates who became 'admirals all for England's sake', and were well rewarded by the Queen for their exploits. This highly original book argues that the deeply ingrained piratical and self-interested approach to naval warfare by these English captains almost allowed the Armada to succeed. A radical reassessment of Elizabethan maritime history, <i>Pirate Nation</i> makes this and a number of other startling revelations about the myth and the reality of Elizabethan naval policy. A highly readable work, this radical reappraisal of Elizabethan maritime practice offers provocative insights about some of the most cherished events in British history.</p></p><p>David Childs is a retired Royal Navy officer, who worked as the Development Director of the <i>Mary Rose</i> Trust, where he became interested in Tudor maritime history.

Michael is raised by Martians, and he arrives on Earth as a true innocent: he has never seen a woman and has no knowledge of Earth's cultures or religions. But he brings turmoil with him, as he is the legal heir to an enormous financial empire, not to mention <i>de facto</i> owner of the planet Mars. With the irascible popular author Jubal Harshaw to protect him, Michael explores human morality and the meanings of love. He founds his own church, preaching free love and disseminating the psychic talents taught him by the Martians. Ultimately, he confronts the fate reserved for all messiahs. <p> The impact of <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> was considerable, leading many children of the 60's to set up households based on Michael's water-brother nests. Heinlein loved to pontificate through the mouths of his characters, so modern readers must be willing to overlook the occasional sour note ("Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault."). That aside, <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> is one of the master's best entertainments, provocative as he always loved to be. Can you grok it? <i>--Brooks Peck</i></p>Robert Anson Heinlein was born in Missouri in 1907, and was raised there. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929, but was forced by illness to retire from the Navy in 1934. He settled in California and over the next five years held a variety of jobs while doing post-graduate work in mathematics and physics at the University of California. In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to <b>Astounding</b> magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre. <p> He was a four-time winner of the Hugo Award for his novels <b>Stranger in a Strange Land</b> (1961), <b>Starship Troopers</b> (1959), <b>Double Star</b> (1956), and <b>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</b> (1966). His <b>Future History</b> series, incorporating both short stories and novels, was first mapped out in 1941. The series charts the social, political, and technological changes shaping human society from the present through several centuries into the future. </p><p> Robert A. Heinlein's books were among the first works of science fiction to reach bestseller status in both hardcover and paperback. he continued to work into his eighties, and his work never ceased to amaze, to entertain, and to generate controversy. By the time hed died, in 1988, it was evident that he was one of the formative talents of science fiction: a writer whose unique vision, unflagging energy, and persistence, over the course of five decades, made a great impact on the American mind.</p></p><h2>Paths of Life: American Indians of the Southwest and Northern Mexico</h2><p>This monograph marks the first presentation of a detailed Classic period ceramic chronology for central and southern Veracruz, the first detailed study of a Gulf Coast pottery production locale, and the first sourcing-distribution study of a Gulf Coast pottery complex.</p><p>Within these pages are living portraits of fifteen Native American groups of Arizona and northern Mexico. The Navajos, the Western Apaches, the Hualapais, Yavapais, and Havasupais, the Yaquis, the Oaodham, the Tarahumaras, the Southern Paiutes, the Seris, the Colorado River Yumans--Quechan, Mohaves, Cocopas, and Maricopas--and the Hopis. Literally and figuratively, the paths they walk are the same paths walked by their ancestors, going back hundreds and even thousands of years. Through history, most of these groups have seen their homelands conquered by outside military forces and their people scattered far and wide. Yet, despite years of exile and subjugation, they have all kept alive their cultures, their sense of being a people. This book explores the symbols, rituals, and words that have ensured continuity and that distinguish each group from others. Equally important, &#34;Paths of Life&#34; describes the dynamic changes that are occurring in each group as new ideas are incorporated into traditional ways of life. The book focuses on one major cultural theme for each group. The chapter on the Navajos, for example, illustrates how the work of sheepherding reinforces the DinA(c) way of relating to one another and living off the land, while the chapter on the Yaquis examines how Catholic and Native rituals have become fused into a uniquely meaningful Yaqui religion. Throughout the book, the guidance and advice of respected Indian scholars have ensured both accuracy and authenticity. The pages in this volume are filled with individuals like Victoriano Churro, &#34;a man who ran like a deer,&#34; and artist Grace Mitchell: &#34;Iam going to weave a basket. Iall gather mulberry shoots, split them and rollthem . . .&#34; There are glimpses of the Yaqui flower world, &#34;Wilderness world / flower freely, is blowing, / wilderness world,&#34; and the Seri creation myth, &#34;Slender whirlwinds coming from the sky touch the land. / Sounds of arrows / striking the ground, / roaring, / raising dust clouds.&#34; Here also are Father Sun and Mother Moon, Rock Crystal Boy and Yellow Corn Girl, Spider Woman, Wolf, and of course Coyote. Among the many books written about these groups, Paths of Life is rare for its breadth of information. The book includes dozens of photographs, both color and black-and-white, as well as a number of short asides, which discuss special points of interest. Readers in search of even more information will appreciate a carefully selected list of suggested additional reading. Encompassing anthropology, history, Native American cultures, arts, and folklore, at heart this is a book for anyone--teacher, student, armchair traveler, general reader--whose imagination has been captured by the lands and peoples of the Greater Southwest.Within these pages are living portraits of fifteen Native American groups of Arizona and northern Mexico.

Out of this maelstrom emerged a military leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, commander of the revolutionary army, who would conquer Italy and Egypt before returning to Paris to proclaim himself emperor. As Napoleon gained power in France, the world stood on the brink of total war. By 1805 the general was making plans to cross the channel and invade England. The subsequent drama reaches from the frozen plains surrounding Moscow to the Caribbean waters, from the debating chamber of the Parliament to the muddy fields of Waterloo. The Great French Wars (1793-1815) can truly be called the first global war; it was also the first conflict driven by industrial might.

When the two-hundred year war between the kingdoms of Vania and Landsing ended the Landsingers were left in triumphant possession of Vania&#39;s rich coal and coast territories. When young King Troven assumed the throne of Vania thirty years later, he was determined to restore her greatness, not through waging another assault upon their traditional enemies, but by looking in the opposite direction and colonising the wild plains and steppes to their east. Over the next twenty years, cavalry forces manage to subdue the rolling plains formerly wasted on nomadic herders and tribesmen.Troven&#39;s campaign restores the pride of the Varnian military and to reward them, Troven creates a new nobility that is extremely loyal to their monarch. Beyond the grasslands lies the current frontier of Varnia, the heavily forested Barrier Mountains, home to enigmatic Specks: a dappled, forest dwelling people, unable to tolerate the heat and full sunlight of the plains. The new settlers find the Specks slightly dim-witted and overly placid, and yet strangely difficult to control. There are tales that they are &#39;blood-drinkers&#39; and their nature worship of ancestral trees has presented difficulties for those who wish to harvest the forest&#39;s exotic timber. They also harbour strange diseases, ones that cause the Specks little more than a week or two of discomfort but which frequently kills those settlers and soldiers who fall victim to it. For that reason, prolonged contact, and especially intimate contact with the Specks is judged both fool-hardy and disgusting. Nevare Gerar is the second son of one of King Troven&#39;s new lords. Following in his father&#39;s footsteps, a commission as a cavalry officer at the frontier and an advantageous marriage await him, once he has completed his training at the King&#39;s Cavalry Academy.</p><p>Robin Hobb was born in California in 1952 and majored in Communications at Denver University, Colorado. Assassin&#39;s Apprentice was her first novel, and was followed by the equally successful Royal Assassin and Assassin&#39;s Quest. She lives outside Seattle, Washington.A big, splendid novel opens the Soldier Son trilogy. Nevare Burville has spent some time as a cavalry officer on the kingdom of Gernia's frontier, engaged in expanding it against the wild nomads of the plains. He has been successful as a soldier, he is happily engaged, and he is the scion of one of the new noble families. Unfortunately, now he has to complete his military education at the King's Cavalry Academy, which is dominated by scions of the old nobility, who have no use for upstarts like Nevare. Also, it appears that Nevare has been too long within range of the powerful magic of the shamans of the western tribes, and their influence has converted him into a sort of sorcerous Typhoid Mary--and he may not be the only one. The consequences for Nevare personally are grim, and for Gernia potentially grimmer, if a way to fight the "barbarian" magic isn't extracted from civilized knowledge. Oh yes, Hobb's characterization, especially anent the ethical dilemmas, and world building are again superb. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Edward O Wilson, the pioneer of sociobiology and biodiversity, once again breaks out of the conventions of current thinking. He shows how our explosive rise in intellectual mastery of the truths of our universe has its roots in the ancient Greek concept of an intrinsic orderliness that governs our cosmos. It is a vision that found its apogee in the Age of Enlightenment, then gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialisation of knowledge in the last two centuries. Professor Wilson shows why the goals of the original Enlightenment are surging back to life, why they are reappearing on the very frontiers of science and human scholarship, and how they are beginning to sketch themselves as the blueprint of our world.</p><p>The biologist Edward O. Wilson is a rare scientist: having over a long career made signal contributions to population genetics, evolutionary biology, entomology, and ethology, he has also steeped himself in philosophy, the humanities, and the social sciences. The result of his lifelong, wide-ranging investigations is <i>Consilience</i> (the word means "a jumping together," in this case of the many branches of human knowledge), a wonderfully broad study that encourages scholars to bridge the many gaps that yawn between and within the cultures of science and the arts. No such gaps should exist, Wilson maintains, for the sciences, humanities, and arts have a common goal: to give understanding a purpose, to lend to us all "a conviction, far deeper than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws." In making his synthetic argument, Wilson examines the ways (rightly and wrongly) in which science is done, puzzles over the postmodernist debates now sweeping academia, and proposes thought-provoking ideas about religion and human nature. He turns to the great evolutionary biologists and the scholars of the Enlightenment for case studies of science properly conducted, considers the life cycles of ants and mountain lions, and presses, again and again, for rigor and vigor to be brought to bear on our search for meaning. The time is right, he suggests, for us to understand more fully that quest for knowledge, for "<i>Homo sapiens</i>, the first truly free species, is about to decommission natural selection, the force that made us.... Soon we must look deep within ourselves and decide what we wish to become." Wilson's wisdom, eloquently expressed in the pages of this grand and lively summing-up, will be of much help in that search.An enormous intellectual adventure. In this groundbreaking new book, the American biologist Edward O. Wilson, considered to be one of the world&#39;s greatest living scientists, argues for the fundamental unity of all knowledge and the need to search for consilience--the proof that everything in our world is organized in terms of a small number of fundamental natural laws that comprise the principles underlying every branch of learning. Professor Wilson, the pioneer of sociobiology and biodiversity, now once again breaks out of the conventions of current thinking. He shows how and why our explosive rise in intellectual mastery of the truths of our universe has its roots in the ancient Greek concept of an intrinsic orderliness that governs our cosmos and the human species--a vision that found its apogee in the Age of Enlightenment, then gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialization of knowledge in the last two centuries. Drawing on the physical sciences and biology, anthropology, psychology, religion, philosophy, and the arts, Professor Wilson shows why the goals of the original Enlightenment are surging back to life, why they are reappearing on the very frontiers of science and humanistic scholarship, and how they are beginning to sketch themselves as the blueprint of our world as it most profoundly, elegantly, and excitingly is.</p><h2>The Machiavelli Covenant</h2><p>For five hundred years a despotic order of the supremely rich and powerful has kept a little known manuscript by the political thinker Niccolo Machiavelli hidden away under heavy guard: <i>THE COVENANT</i>, a terrifying blueprint for the gaining and keeping of true political power. Bonded by complicity in ritual murder and dedicated to a singular vision of global domination, the group, guided by Machiavelli's document, has prospered far beyond any dreams of power and avarice.<br>In Washington, D.C., former LAPD detective Nicholas Marten comes out of hiding when he learns his former girlfriend, her child and husband, a U.S. congressman, have been mysteriously murdered. Marten discovers her husband had just uncovered a top-secret and illegal bioweapons program, and when the feds fail to investigate, Marten resolves to go after the killers himself.<br>Meanwhile, on his way to a NATO summit in Warsaw, President John Henry Harris is confronted by a secret cabal inside his own White House who demand he authorize the assassinations of the Chancellor of Germany and the President of France at the NATO meeting. He angrily refuses, knowing full well that in doing so he has put his own life and the fate of the country in jeopardy.<br>Fleeing for his life, Harris joins forces with Marten and the beautiful but enigmatic French photo-journalist Demi Picard. Together they uncover the truth about the most devastating and powerful group the world has ever known. Swept from Washington to Paris, from Berlin to Malta, Madrid to Barcelona they flee a ruthless circle of the president's here-to-fore most trusted advisors, military leaders and transnational corporate chieftains all of whom want them dead.

His own breath, as he inhaled and exhaled, resonated as if it were a movie sound track. So did the sound of Caroline's labored breathing as she lay on the bed next to him.<br>&nbsp;<br>For what seemed the tenth time in half that many minutes he looked at her. Her eyes were closed, as they had been, her hand resting gently in his. For all the life in it, it might as well have been a glove. Nothing more.<br>&nbsp;<br>How long had he been in Washington? Two days? Three? Flown there from his home in Manchester, England, almost immediately after Caroline's call asking him to come. He'd known the minute he heard her voice something was terribly wrong. It had been filled with dread and fear and helplessness, and then she'd told him what it was: She had a very aggressive, untreatable staph infection and was expected to live only a few days more.<br>&nbsp;<br>For all the horror and shock of it, there had been something more in her voice. Anger. Something had been done to her, she told him, suddenly whispering as if she were afraid someone would overhear. No matter what the doctors said or would say, she was certain that the infection killing her had been caused by bacteria that had deliberately been given to her. It had been then, judging from sounds in the background, that someone had come into the room. Abruptly she'd finished with an urgent plea for him to come to Washington, then hung up.<br>&nbsp;<br>He hadn't known what to think. All he knew was that she was terribly frightened and that her situation was made all the worse by the very recent deaths of her husband and twelve-year-old son in the crash of a private plane off the coast of California. Considering the physical and emotional toll the combination of these tragic things would have had on her, and with no other information, Marten found it impossible to know if there was any basis at all for her suspicion. Still, the reality was that she was desperately ill and wanted him to be with her. And from everything he'd heard in her voice he knew he'd better get there as quickly as he could.<br>&nbsp;<br>And he had. Within the day flying from Manchester in the north of England to London and then on to Washington, D.C., taking a taxi from Dulles International directly to the hospital, and later getting a room at a hotel nearby. That Caroline knew who he really was and the risk she dared subject him to by asking him to come back into the United States had not been brought up. It wasn't necessary. She would never have asked if something wasn't terribly wrong.<br>&nbsp;<br>So he had come hurriedly back to the country he had fled four years earlier in fear for his life and that of his sister. Come back--after so many years and the differing paths their lives had taken--because Caroline had been and was still the one true love of his life. He loved her more deeply than any woman he had ever known and in a way that was impossible for him to describe. He knew too that even though she was happily married and had been for a long time, in some unspoken, even profound way, she felt the same about him.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Marten looked up sharply as the room door was suddenly flung open. A heavyset nurse entered followed by two men in dark suits. The first was broad-shouldered, in his early forties, with dark curly hair. "You'll have to leave, sir, please," he said respectfully.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The president is coming," the nurse said curtly, her manner abrupt and authoritative, as if she had suddenly become commander of the suits. A member of the Secret Service.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the same instant Marten felt Caroline's hand tighten around his. He looked down and saw her eyes were open. They were wide and clear, and looked into his the way they had that first day they met, when they were both sixteen and in high school.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I love you," she whispered.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I love you too," he whispered back.<br>&nbsp;<br>She looked at him for a half second more, then closed her eyes, and her hand relaxed.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Please, sir, you have to leave, now," the first suit said. At that same moment a tall, slim, silver-haired man in a dark blue suit stepped through the doorway. There was no question who he was--John Henry Harris, president of the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>Marten looked at him directly. "Please," he said softly, "give me a moment alone with her. . . . She's just . . ."--the word caught in his throat, "died."<br>&nbsp;<br>The men's gaze held for the briefest moment, "Of course," the president said, his words hushed and reverent. Then, motioning to his Secret Service protectors, turned and left the room.<br>&nbsp;<br>2<br>&nbsp;<br>Thirty minutes later, head down against the world, barely aware of the direction he was going, Nicholas Marten walked the all but deserted Sunday-night streets of the city.<br>&nbsp;<br>He tried not to think of Caroline. Tried not to acknowledge the pain that told him she was no more. Tried not to think that it had been little more than three weeks since she had lost both her husband and son. Tried to put out of his mind the idea that she might have been intentionally given something that caused her fatal infection.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Something has been done to me." Her voice suddenly echoed inside him as if she had just spoken. It resonated with the same fear and vulnerability and anger it had had when she had first called him in England.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Something has been done to me." Caroline's words came again. As if she were still trying to reach him, trying to make him believe without doubt that she had not been merely ill, but murdered.<br>&nbsp;<br>What that "something" was, or at least what she thought it was and how it had begun, she'd told him during the first of the only two lucid moments she'd had since he arrived.<br>&nbsp;<br>It had happened following the twin funerals of her husband, Mike Parsons, a well-respected forty-two-year-old congressman from California in his second term in office, and their son, Charlie. Certain she was strong enough to see it all through, she had invited numerous friends to their home to join her in a celebration of their lives; but the shock of what had happened, coupled with the almost unbearable strain of the funerals and the crush of well-meaning people, had overwhelmed her, and she'd broken down, retreating in tears and near-hysteria to lock herself in her bedroom, screaming for people to go away and refusing even to answer the door.<br>&nbsp;<br>Congressional chaplain and pastor of their church, Reverend Rufus Beck, had been among the mourners and immediately sent for Caroline's personal physician, Lorraine Stephenson. Dr. Stephenson had come quickly and with the pastor's help convinced Caroline to open the bedroom door. Within minutes she had injected her, as Caroline said, "with a sedative of some kind." When she woke up she was in a room in a private clinic where Stephenson had prescribed several days' rest and where "I never felt the same again."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Marten turned down one darkened street and then another, replaying the hours he had spent with her in the hospital. With the exception of the other instance when Caroline had been awake and talked to him, she had simply slept, and he had stayed by her side keeping vigil. Throughout those long hours health care personnel monitoring her condition had come and gone and there had been brief visits by friends during which Marten simply introduced himself and then quietly left the room.<br>&nbsp;<br>There had been two other visitors as well, the people who had been immediately involved when Caroline had broken down at home. The first had been an early-morning call by the woman who had given her the "sedative" and prescribed her stay in the clinic, her personal physician, Dr. Lorraine Stephenson: a tall, handsome woman in her mid-fifties. Stephenson had exchanged a brief pleasantry with him, then read Caroline's chart, listened to her heart and lungs through a stethoscope, and left.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second had been congressional chaplain Rufus Beck, who visited later in the day. A large, gentle, soft-spoken African-American, Beck had been accompanied by a young and attractive dark-haired Caucasian woman with a camera bag slung over one shoulder who'd stayed pretty much in the background. Like Stephenson, Reverend Beck had introduced himself to Marten, and they'd had a brief exchange. Afterward he'd spent a few moments in prayer as Caroline slept before telling Marten good-bye and leaving with the young woman.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A light rain began to fall and Marten stopped to turn up the collar of his jacket against it. In the distance he could see the tall spire that was the Washington Monument. For the first time he had some concrete sense of where he was. Washington was not just the inside of an intensive-care hospital room but a large metropolitan city that just happened to be the capital of the United States of America. It was a place he'd never been, even though he'd lived all of his life in California before fleeing to England and could easily have visited. For some reason just being here gave him a deep sense of belonging, to one's country, to one's native land. It was a feeling he'd never had before, and he wondered if there would ever be a time when he could return from the exiled life he lived in Manchester.<br>&nbsp;<br>Marten moved on. As he did he noticed a car coming slowly down the street toward him. That the streets were all but empty made the vehicle's pace seem odd. It was late Sunday night and raining--wouldn't the driver of one of the very few vehicles on the street be anxious to get to wherever he or she was going? The car came abreast of him and he glanced at it as it passed. The driver was male and nondescript, middle-aged with dark hair. The car passed and Marten watched it continue down the street, its speed never changing. Maybe the guy was drunk or drugged out or--suddenly the reflection became personal--maybe he was somebody who had just lost someone extraordinarily dear to him and had no idea where he was or what he was doing other than just moving.<br>&nbsp;<br>3<br>&nbsp;<br>Marten's thoughts went back to Caroline. She had been the wife of a well-respected congressman who had become an increasingly popular figure in Washington and one who just happened to have been a close boyhood friend of the president, and the sudden, tragic deaths of both her husband and son had seen the political community embrace her with everything it had. It made him wonder why she would think "something had been done to her." Why she would think she had deliberately been injected with a disease that would kill her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Methodically Marten tried to assess her mental state over the last two days of her life. In particular he thought of the second instance when she had been awake. That time she'd taken hold of his hand and looked into his eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Nicholas," she'd said weakly. "I--" Her mouth had been dry and her breathing labored. Just speaking took enormous effort. "I was to . . . have . . . been . . . on that plane with . . . my husband and my . . . son. There was a . . . last-minute change . . . of plans . . . and I . . . came back to . . . Washington a . . . day . . . earlier." She had stared at him intently. "They . . . murdered my . . . husband and . . . son . . . and now they have . . . killed . . . me."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Who are you talking about? Who is 'they'?" he'd pressed gently, trying to get something more tangible from her.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The . . . ca . . ." she'd said. She'd tried to say more but it had been as much as she could do. Her strength gone, she just lay back and fell asleep. And she had slept right up until those last moments of her life when she'd opened her eyes and stared into his and told him she loved him.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thinking about it now he realized the little she had told him had come in two sections, one quite separate from the other. The first had come in snippets: that she was originally to have been on the ill-fated plane with her husband and son but a last-minute change of plans brought her back to Washington a day earlier; what had happened at her home after the funerals; and finally what she had told him when she'd called him in England, saying she was dying from a staph infection caused by a strain of untreatable bacteria that she was certain had been given to her deliberately. "The . . . ca"--what she'd started to say when he'd asked her to explain it, and who the "they" were she was referring to, he had no idea.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second section had come from utterances she'd made in her sleep. Most had been everyday things, calling out the names of her husband, "Mike," or her son, "Charlie," or her sister "Katy," or saying things like "Charlie, please turn down the TV" or "The class is Tuesday." But she'd said other things too. These had seemingly been aimed at her husband and were filled with alarm or fear or both. "Mike, what is it?" Or "You're frightened. I can see it!" Or "Why won't you tell me what it is?" Or "It's the others, isn't it?" And then later, a sudden fearful blurting--"I don't like the white-haired man."<br>&nbsp;<br>That part he was familiar with because it was a piece of the story she had told him when she'd called him in Manchester and asked him to come.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The fever came less than a day after I woke up in the clinic," she'd said. "It got worse and they did tests. A white-haired man came, they said he was a specialist but I didn't like him. Everything about him frightened me. The way he stared at me. The way he touched my face and my legs with his long, hideous fingers; and that horrid thumb with its tiny balled cross. I asked him why he was there and what he was doing but he never answered. Later they discovered I had some kind of staph infection in the bone of my right leg. They tried to treat it with antibiotics. But they didn't work. Nothing worked."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Marten walked on. The rain came down harder but he barely noticed. His entire focus was Caroline. They had met in high school and entered the same college certain they would marry and have children and be together for the rest of their lives. And then she had gone away for the summer and met a young lawyer named Mike Parsons. After that, his life and hers changed forever. But as deep as his hurt, as badly as he had been wounded, his love for her never diminished. In time he and Mike became friends, and he told Mike what Caroline and only a few others knew--who he really was and why he had been forced to leave his job as a homicide detective in the Los Angeles Police Department and move to the north of England to live under an assumed identity as a landscape architect.<br>&nbsp;<br>He wished now he had gone to the funeral of her husband and son as he'd wanted to. Because if he had he would have been there when she'd broken down and when Dr. Stephenson had come. But he hadn't, and that had been Caroline's doing. She had told him she was surrounded by friends and that her sister and husband were coming from their home in Hawaii, and that, considering the danger surrounding his own situation, it was better he stayed where he was. They would...</p><h2>The God We Never Knew: Beyond Dogmatic Religion to a More Authentic Contemporary Faith</h2><p>Explains how to create an authentic contemporary faith that reconciles God with critical thinking, religious pluralism, and science</p><p>Answering the many "spiritual" questions left unaddressed by such popular historical bestsellers as a <i> A History of God </i> and <i> God: A Biography </i>, renowned author Marcus Borg reveals how to embrace an authentic contemporary faith that reconciles God with science, critical thinking and religious pluralism. <p>How to have faith -- how to even think about God -- without having to stifle modern rationality is one of the most vital challenges facing contemporary religion. In providing a much-needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet fully contemporary understanding of God, Borg --author of the bestselling <i> Meeting Jesus Again for the first Time </i> -- traces his personal journey. He leads readers from the all-powerful and authoritarian God of his (and their) childhood and traditional faith to an equally powerful but dynamic image of God that is relevant to contemporary seekers and more biblical and spiritually authentic. Borg shows how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in delusion --misinterpretation of biblical texts and of God's true nature -- and challenges readers to a new way of thinking about God. He opens a practical discussion about how to base a relationship with the divine both immanent and transcendant, here and now, always and everywhere. </p><p>Arguing that the authentic Judeo-Christian tradition is that God's being includes the whole world, Borg persuasively shows how this understanding accounts for the whole variety of human religious experience. Ultimately, he introduces readers to a way of thinking about God who is "right here" all around them, rather than distant and remote. This understanding is more intellectually and spiritually satisfying and allows readers to reclaim a stronger sense of God's presence.</p><p></p>Answering the vital contemporary theological and spiritual questions that fall outside the scope of such popular historical bestsellers such as <i>A History of God</i> and <i>God: A Biography,</i> Marcus Borg leads us to a fresh, contemporary, yet deeply grounded experience of God in our minds--and hearts. <p>"For me, the problem was thus centrally intellectual, even though it deeply affected the rest of my life. For a variety of good reasons, not everybody experiences a serious intellectual problem with the notion of God. But some do. For my own religious journey, the resolution of the intellectual problem was indispensable; without it, I would still be on the outside of the Christian life looking in."--from <i>The God We Never Knew</i> </p><p>How to have faith--even to think about God--without having to stifle modern rational thought is one of the most vital challenges facing many of us today. Marcus Borg, author of the bestselling <i>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time,</i> traces his personal spiritual journey to the discovery of an authentic yet fully contemporary understanding of God. In a compelling, readable way, he leads us from the distant, authoritarian God of our childhood to an equally powerful, dynamic adult image of God--"the beyond in our midst," the life spirit that is within us and all around us--that reconciles faith with science, history, critical thinking, and religious pluralism.</p></p><h2>Living in Color: Embracing God&#39;s Passion for Diversity</h2><p>Woodley, a Keetoowah Cherokee and pastor, affirms God&#39;s delight in diversity and offers a compelling biblical model for racial reconciliation in churches and nations.</p><p>Randy Woodley, M.Div., a Keetoowah Cherokee, and his wife, Edith, an Eastern Shoshone, founded Eagle&#39;s Wings Ministry, a culturally contextual ministry among Native Americans.

In <i>Geography and Trade</i> he provides a stimulating synthesis of ideas in the literature and describes new models for implementing a study of economic geography that could change the nature of the field.

It is, scientists say, the worst global extinction crisis in the last sixty-five million years -- the hemorrhage of thirty thousand irreplaceable life-forms each year. And yet, every so often one of these lost species resurfaces, such as the Indian forest owlet, considered extinct for more than a century when it was rediscovered in 1997. Like heirlooms plucked from a burning house, they are gifts to an increasingly impoverished world.<br><br>In <i>The Ghost with Trembling Wings</i>, naturalist Scott Weidensaul pursues these stories of loss and recovery, of endurance against the odds, and of surprising resurrections. The search takes Weidensaul to the rain forests of the Caribbean and Brazil in pursuit of long-lost birds, to the rugged mountains of Tasmania for the striped, wolflike marsupial known as the thylacine, to cloning laboratories where scientists struggle to re-create long-extinct animals, and even to the moorlands and tidy farms of England on the trail of mysterious black panthers whose existence seems to depend on the faith of those looking for them. <i>The Ghost with Trembling Wings</i> is a book of exploration and a survey of the frontiers of modern science and wildlife biology. It is, in the end, the story of our desire for a wilder, bigger, more complete world.<br></p><p>Scott Weidensaul is the author of <i>Living on the Wind: Across the Hemisphere with Migratory Birds</i>, which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, and <i>Mountains of the Heart</i>. He lives in the Pennsylvania Appalachians.<br>Approximately 30,000 species of animals and plants go extinct every year. Weidensaul's narrative concerns those rare occurrences when a supposedly extinct animal makes a surprise reappearance, and the much more frequent occasions when scientists or civilians only think they've sighted a vanished creature. His suspenseful naturalist detective stories take readers all over the globe to Madagascar, Indonesia, Peru, Costa Rica in search of these lost species. In the swamplands of Louisiana, the author and his guide brave swarming mosquitoes and deadly vipers to check out reports of an ivory-billed woodpecker. Weidensaul (Living on the Wind) recounts famous success stories, like the recovery of the coelacanth, a fish believed to be extinct for about 80 million years until fishermen landed one off the coast of South Africa in 1938, as well as various wild goose chases and his own obsessive search for the South American cone-billed tanager. Along the way, he shows how humans and nature have unwittingly conspired to condemn animals to oblivion, such as the dozens of Great Lakes fish species lost to overfishing and the inadvertent introduction of parasitic lampreys from canals built in the 19th century. For the most part, though, Weidensaul's gracefully written book strikes a hopeful note, reveling in the exhilaration of the searches themselves: the greatest gift these lost creatures give this too-fast, too-small, too-modern world [is] an opportunity for hope.

His integrity, passion, and commitment to excellence have earned the praise of colleagues both Democrat and Republican. In this timely and inspirational book, Zell Miller recounts the simple but powerful lessons he learned as a United States Marine: the core values we must embrace if we are to be successful as individuals and as a nation. Only by incorporating such time-honored Marine qualities as pride, discipline, courage, brotherhood, and respect into our personal and professional lives can we meet the challenges that lie ahead. In <i>Corps Values,</i> Zell Miller urges us all to go back to basic training--in the values that ultimately lead to victory in any endeavor.</p><p>Call it Robert Fulghum by way of John Wayne... In 1953, Zell Miller was as low as he could get. He'd dropped out of college after being made to feel inferior because of his "hillbilly" background and wound up in jail one weekend after getting drunk on moonshine and driving his car into a ditch. In an effort to turn his life around, he signed up for marine boot camp. The experience changed his life, and he remains convinced that the values he learned during his 90 days at Parris Island are "the only basis upon which diversity can coexist with commonality and all people can pursue individual goals for themselves while contributing to the general well-being and advancement of society as a whole." These simple values, from neatness and punctuality to discipline and loyalty, are for Miller the basis of a strong civil society. Although some readers may find some of his notions--such as his frustration at seeing kids wear caps backwards--a bit extreme, Miller reminds us that any organization that pumped out men like Bernard Shaw, Don Imus, Ted Williams, and Art Buchwald must have <i>something</i> going for it."When it comes to politics and politicians, we don't agree on much, but one thing we do agree on is that Gov. Zell Miller is a helluva man and he has written a helluva book!"<br>--James Carville and Mary Matalin<br> <br><i>"Corps Values</i> touches at the core of what has made America great."<br>--Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House of Representatives<p>"Gov. Zell Miller gives the nation hope for its future by reinforcing 'corps' values which made this country great.

Livingston, Jr., Major General, USMC (Ret.), Medal of Honor winner</p><p>"As a brother Marine, it's easy to see why Zell Miller has been so successful. He has hit a grand slam with this book." <br>--Ted Williams, Baseball Hall of Famer</p></p><h2>Shattered Air: A True Account of Catastrophe and Courage on Yosemite&#39;s Half Dome</h2><p>The compelling account of recklessness, tragedy, courage and rescue, a book whose sobering depiction of nature&#39;s danger is tempered by unforgettable portraits of the triumphant human spirit.</p><p><p><strong>Bob Madgic</strong> is a retired public-school administrator and now a full-time writer on the outdoors. He lives in Anderson, California.</p>In 1985 two hikers were killed by lightning while climbing Yosemiteï¿½s Half Dome, which has been described as a ï¿½granite lightning rod.ï¿½ This is their story, and much more. Madgic explores the history of Yosemite, the damage lightning can do, methods to treat it, the efforts of a female EMT who kept the injured alive until a helicopter could come, and the hikersï¿½ backgrounds. Anthony Healdï¿½s slightly husky voice is perfect for this outdoor horror story. He adds foreshadowing when describing the gathering clouds, quickens the pace during the storm, and injects personality into the follow-up interviews.

Reprint.</p><p>Joan Hess, winner of the American Mystery Award, is the author of eleven previous Claire Malloy mysteries, as well as ten novels in the Maggody series. Currently president of the American Crime Writers League, she lives in Arkansas.With a gusto sure to please Hess's multitude of fans, the 755 residents of Maggody, Ark., flock to Raz Buchanon's corn fields to speculate about the crop circles that have appeared there overnight. Soon TV crews, tabloid reporters and rival UFO scholars join the ranks, finding evidence of otherworldly visitation in the crop circles and a rash of cattle mutilations. Raz, whose close companion is a cantankerous pig named Marjorie, raises his admission charge from $1 to $5; a silver-suited alien is spotted walking on water across a creek. But then the assistant to one of the leading ufologists is killed. Police chief Arly Hanks, whose most recent case was chronicled in O Little Town of Maggody, has her hands full as Maggody's inhabitants pursue the possibility of alien life forms and prominence in tabloid headlines. While Arly questions Maggody's citizens and visitors, one of the ufologists is also murdered.

One contributor charts the distribution saga of Mario Bava&#x2019;s 1972 film <i>Lisa and the Devil</i> through the highs and lows of art cinema, fringe television, grindhouse circuits, and connoisseur DVD markets. Another offers a new perspective on the work of Doris Wishman, the New York housewife turned sexploitation director of the 1960s who has become a cult figure in bad-cinema circles over the past decade. Other contributors analyze the relation between image and sound in sexploitation films and Italian horror movies, the advertising strategies adopted by sexploitation producers during the early 1960s, the relationship between art and trash in Todd Haynes&#x2019;s oeuvre, and the ways that the <i>Friday the 13th</i> series complicates the distinction between &#x201c;trash&#x201d; and &#x201c;legitimate&#x201d; cinema.

Harris joined the army in 1802 and later joined the 95th Rifles, a regiment which became the elite of the Army through their expertise with the rifle, their alertness, discipline and regimental pride. The story unfolds from the moment that the diminutive Harris lands in Portugal and marches away in the sun, weighed down by his kit and great coat, his blanket and camp kettle, his haversack rifle, ammunition, ship-biscuit and beef and all the tools and leather that he had to carry as the battalion&#39;s cobbler.</p><p>Christopher Hibbert was educated at Radley and Oxford.

Beautifully illustrated, nearly every page is filled with color--perhaps with a drawing of a temple, a picture of a cave drawing, a simple map indicating where some historical event took place, or a reproduction of a famous painting depicting some historical event. Each two-page layout has one column of text, while each illustration or map is accompanied by explanations ranging from one or two sentences to one or two paragraphs. Key words in the text for which definitions can be found in the glossary appear in bold-faced type. A timetable of events appears at the end of each volume. Subjects covered in The Ancient World include the peopling of Earth (using a simplistic evolutionary explanation), the first farmers and early civilizations, ancient China and Japan, religions of Eastern Asia, early European civilization, and the early Americas. Exploration and Empire covers the empire builders, European expansion, and the development of science. Similar to the "History as Evidence" series (Warwick) and to the "Picture Histories" and "Everyday Life" series (both Silver Burdett), these book have a large format, clear maps, easy-to-read print, and colorful illustrations. --Dana McDougald, Cedar Shoals High School, Athens, GA<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Song Rising: Limited Edition, Signed by the Author (The Bone Season)</h2><p><p>Following a bloody battle against foes on every side, Paige Mahoney has risen to the dangerous position of Underqueen, ruling over London's criminal population. </p><p>But, having turned her back on Jaxon Hall and with vengeful enemies still at large, the task of stabilizing the fractured underworld has never seemed so challenging. </p><p>Little does Paige know that her reign may be cut short by the introduction of Senshield, a deadly technology that spells doom for the clairvoyant community and the world as they know it . . .</p></p><p><p><b>Samantha Shannon</b> was born in West London in 1991.

But by the Second World War, prominent figures in both camps celebrated the judiciary for protecting freedom of speech. In this strikingly original history, Laura Weinrib illustrates how a surprising coalition of lawyers and activists made judicial enforcement of the Bill of Rights a defining feature of American democracy.</p><p><i>The Taming of Free Speech</i> traces our understanding of civil liberties to conflict between 1910 and 1940 over workers&#x2019; right to strike. As self-proclaimed partisans in the class war, the founders of the American Civil Liberties Union promoted a bold vision of free speech that encompassed unrestricted picketing and boycotts. Over time, however, they subdued their rhetoric to attract adherents and prevail in court. At the height of the New Deal, many liberals opposed the ACLU&#x2019;s litigation strategy, fearing it would legitimize a judiciary they deemed too friendly to corporations and too hostile to the administrative state. Conversely, conservatives eager to insulate industry from government regulation pivoted to embrace civil liberties, despite their radical roots. The resulting transformation in constitutional jurisprudence&#x2015;often understood as a triumph for the Left&#x2015;was in fact a calculated bargain.</p><p>America&#x2019;s civil liberties compromise saved the courts from New Deal attack and secured free speech for labor radicals and businesses alike. Ever since, competing groups have clashed in the arena of ideas, shielded by the First Amendment.</p></p><p>Laura Weinrib is Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and Suzanne Young Murray Professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.&#x201c;Utterly brilliant...Balanced and restrained in her writing but original and subversive in her argument, Weinrib stops short of offering morals from this history...Most important, Weinrib reanimates a strange time when the forces of business and the forces of labor were engaged in a pitched battle about the way Americans should construct their economy. When you go looking for the origins of civil libertarianism, it turns out, you find a class struggle...Weinrib&#x2019;s book is an extraordinary reminder of why history matters to the present.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Samuel Moyn</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] important revisionist history of the origins of American civil liberties...Offer[s] important correctives to the celebratory accounts of civil liberties that we so often tell ourselves.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Cole</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Taming of Free Speech</i> is...a complex story about the evolution of political and legal tactics within competing organizations and among the notable cast of characters at their helm...

Ever the Catholic Church's "faithful critic," Kung displays a dazzling breadth of scholarship. Professor of ecumenical theology at the University of Tubingen, he bases his approach on five historical paradigm shifts: Jewish apocalyptic Christianity, early church ecumenism, the Roman system in the medieval papal church, the Reformation, and modern democracy. He notes dominant influences in each, presenting his convictions on the essence of Christianity and moving toward a polycentrism where Orthodox, Catholic, and evangelical traditions are not mutually exclusive. Over 30 diagrams and many stimulating "questions for the future" sidebars are included. Not all readers will accept the views of this Vatican II peritus (nor did the Vatican in 1973). But the work is a remarkable achievement for a church always in need of reform and reformers.

But Koschei has never before been seen through the eyes of Catherynne Valente, whose modernized and transformed take on the legend brings the action to modern times, spanning many of the great developments of Russian history in the twentieth century.Deathless, however, is no dry, historical tome: it lights up like fire as the young Marya Morevna transforms from a clever child of the revolution, to Koschei&#x20ac;&#x2122;s beautiful bride, to his eventual undoing. Along the way there are Stalinist house elves, magical quests, secrecy and bureaucracy, and games of lust and power. All told, Deathless is a collision of magical history and actual history, of revolution and mythology, of love and death, which will bring Russian myth back to life in</p><p><p>CATHERYNNE M.

By a long, thin window, a child in a pale blue dress and pale green slippers waited for a bird to marry her.<br>This would be cause for most girls to be very gently closed up in their rooms until they ceased to think such alarming things, but Marya Morevna had seen all three of her sisters&#x2019; husbands from her window before they knocked at the great cherrywood door, and thus she was as certain of her own fate as she was certain of the color of the moon.<br>The first came when Marya was only six, and her sister Olga was tall as she was fair, her golden hair clapped back like a hay-roll in autumn. It was a silvery damp day, and long, thin clouds rolled up onto their roof like neat cigarettes. Marya watched from the upper floor as birds gathered in the oak trees, sniping and snapping at the first and smallest drops of rain, which all winged creatures know are the sweetest, like tiny grapes bursting on the tongue. She laughed to see the rooks skirmish over the rain, and as she did, the flock turned as one to look at her, their eyes like needle points. One of them, a fat black fellow, leaned perilously forward on his green branch and, without taking his gaze from Marya&#x2019;s window, fell hard&#x2014;thump, bash!&#x2014;onto the streetside. But the little bird bounced up, and when he righted himself, he was a handsome young man in a handsome black uniform, his buttons flashing like raindrops, his nose large and cruelly curved.<br>The young man knocked at the great cherrywood door, and Marya Morevna&#x2019;s mother blushed under his gaze.<br>&#x201c;I have come for the girl in the window,&#x201d; he said with a clipped, sweet voice. &#x201c;I am Lieutenant Gratch of the Tsar&#x2019;s Personal Guard. I have many wonderful houses full of seed, many wonderful fields full of grain, and I have more dresses than she could wear, even if she changed her gown at morning, evening, and midnight each day of her life.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You must mean Olga,&#x201d; said Marya&#x2019;s mother, her hand fluttering to her throat. &#x201c;She is the oldest and most beautiful of all my daughters.&#x201d;<br>And so Olga, who had indeed sat at the first-floor window, which faced the garden full of fallen apples and not the street, was brought to the door. She was filled like a wineskin with the rich sight of her handsome young man in his handsome black uniform, and kissed him very chastely on the cheeks. They walked together down Gorokhovaya Street, and he bought for her a golden hat with long black feathers tucked into its brim.<br>When they returned in the evening, Lieutenant Gratch looked up into the violet sky and sighed. &#x201c;This is not the girl in the window. But I will love her as though she was, for I see now that that one is not meant for me.&#x201d;<br>And so Olga went gracefully to the estates of Lieutenant Gratch, and wrote prettily worded letters home to her sisters, in which her verbs built castles and her datives sprung up like well-tended roses.<br>The second husband came when Marya was nine, and her sister Tatiana was sly and ruddy as a fox, her sharp grey eyes clapping upon every fascinating thing. Marya Morevna sat at her window embroidering the hem of a christening dress for Olga&#x2019;s second son. It was spring, and the morning rain had left their long, thin street slick and sparkling, jeweled with wet pink petals. Marya watched from the upper floor as once more the birds gathered in the great oak tree, sniping and snapping for the soaked and wrinkled cherry blossoms, which every winged creature knows are the most savory of all blossoms, like spice cakes melting on the tongue. She laughed to see the plovers scuffle over the flowers, and as she did, the flock turned as one to look at her, their eyes like knifepoints. One of them, a little brown fellow, leaned perilously forward on his green branch and, without taking his gaze from Marya&#x2019;s window, fell hard&#x2014;thump, bash!&#x2014;onto the streetside. But the little bird bounced up, and when he righted himself, he was a handsome young man in a handsome brown uniform with a long white sash, his buttons flashing like sunshine, his mouth round and kind.<br>The young man knocked at the great cherrywood door, and Marya Morevna&#x2019;s mother smiled under his gaze.<br>&#x201c;I am Lieutenant Zuyok of the White Guard,&#x201d; he said, for the face of the world had changed. &#x201c;I have come for the girl in the window. I have many wonderful houses full of fruits, many wonderful fields full of worms, and I have more jewels than she could wear, even if she changed her rings at morning, evening, and midnight each day of her life.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You must mean Tatiana,&#x201d; said Marya&#x2019;s mother, pressing her hand to her breast. &#x201c;She is the second oldest and second most beautiful of my daughters.&#x201d;<br>And so Tatiana, who had indeed sat at the first-floor window, which faced the garden full of apple blossoms and not the street, came to the door. She was filled like a silk balloon with the flaming sight of her handsome young man in his handsome brown uniform, and kissed him, not very chastely at all, on the mouth. They walked together through Gorokhovaya Street, and he bought for her a white hat with long chestnut-colored feathers tucked into its brim.<br>When they returned in the evening, Lieutenant Zuyok looked up into the turquoise sky and sighed. &#x201c;This is not the girl in the window. But I will love her as though she was, for I see now that one is not meant for me.&#x201d;<br>And so Tatiana went happily to the estates of Lieutenant Zuyok, and wrote sophisticated letters home to her sisters, in which her verbs danced in square patterns and her datives were laid out like tables set for feasting.<br>The third husband came when Marya was twelve, and her sister Anna was slim and gentle as a fawn, her blush quicker than shadows passing. Marya Morevna sat at her window embroidering the collar of a party dress for Tatiana&#x2019;s first daughter. It was winter, and the snow on Gorokhovaya Street piled high and mounded, like long frozen barrows. Marya watched from the upper floor as once again the birds gathered in the great oak tree, sniping and snapping for the last autumn nuts, stolen from squirrels and hidden in bark-cracks, which every winged creature knows are the most bitter of all nuts, like old sorrows sitting heavy on the tongue. She laughed to see the shrikes scuffle over the acorns, and as she did, the flock turned as one to look at her, their eyes like bayonet points. One of them, a stately grey fellow with a red stripe at his cheek, leaned perilously forward on his green branch and, without taking his gaze from Marya&#x2019;s window, fell hard&#x2014;thump, bash!&#x2014;onto the streetside. But the little bird bounced up, and when he righted himself, he was a handsome young man in a handsome grey uniform with a long red sash, his buttons flashing like streetlamps, his eyes narrow with a wicked cleverness.<br>The young man knocked at the great cherrywood door, and Marya Morevna&#x2019;s mother frowned under his gaze.<br>&#x201c;I am Lieutenant Zhulan of the Red Army,&#x201d; he said, for the face of the world had begun to struggle with itself, unable to decide on its features. &#x201c;I have come for the girl in the window. I have many wonderful houses which I share equally among my fellows, many wonderful rivers full of fish which are shared equally among all those with nets, and I have more virtuous books than she could read, even if she read a different one at morning, evening, and midnight each day of her life.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You must mean Anna,&#x201d; said Marya&#x2019;s mother, her hand firmly at her hip. &#x201c;She is the third oldest and third most beautiful of my daughters.&#x201d;<br>And so Anna, who had indeed sat at the first-floor window, which faced the garden full of bare branches and not the street, was brought to the door. She was filled like a pail of water with the sweet sight of her handsome young man in his handsome grey uniform, and with a terrible shyness allowed him to kiss only her hand. They walked together through the newly named Kommissarskaya Street, and he bought for her a plain grey cap with a red star on the brim.<br>When they returned in the evening, Lieutenant Zhulan looked up into the black sky and sighed. &#x201c;This is not the girl in the window. But I will love her as though she was, for I see now that that one is not meant for me.&#x201d;<br>And so Anna went dutifully to the estates of Lieutenant Zhulan, and wrote properly worded letters home to her sisters, in which her verbs were distributed fairly among the nouns, and her datives asked for no more than they required.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright ï¿½ 2011 by Catherynne M.

Guinn lives in Fort Worth.<b>1 <br><p>The town of Mountain View, in Arizona Territory, was in every respect an impressive place. It bustled at all hours, since the two silver mines on its outskirts were in full operation around the clock. Changing shifts of miners were in constant need of meals in the town&#x2019;s half-dozen restaurants, none of which ever closed. They served quality, highly seasoned fare. After working underground in stifling conditions, when the miners emerged into the fresh air they craved sharp-tasting meals to revive their dulled senses. Freshly&nbsp;prepared Italian, French, and Chinese dishes especially satisfied them. No one on the frontier ate better.</p><p>The scenery was spectacular. The town nestled on the southeast edge of the Pinal Mountain range; the mountain slopes were dotted with saguaro cacti and their jagged peaks rose high in the sky. At first glance the mountains seemed entirely bloodred, but careful viewing revealed subtle ribbons of green, gold, and violet bisecting the rock. Eighteen months earlier beneath that rock, prospectors had first discovered wide seams of black-veined ore. Miners cut deep tunnels underground and extracted the ore, which was then passed through complex chemical washes to extract gleaming bits of silver. There seemed no end to this treasure trove; as strikes continued to be made, there was a constant influx of money into the community. As a result, Mountain View exploded almost overnight into a town of relatively fine houses and business structures, many built with stone and timber imported at considerable expense from California or Mexico. Dormitory-style housing provided shelter for the&nbsp;miners and other lower-class workers. Most mining towns on the Western frontier were hodgepodge collections of canvas tents, adobe hovels, and warped plank shacks. In contrast, Mountain View was a showplace.</p><p>It was also a town of burgeoning cultural sophistication. Large mining concerns headquartered in San Francisco and Denver&nbsp;quickly opened branch offices in Mountain View and staffed them with top-notch assayers, accountants, and engineers. Working mines meant the presence of supervisors to lead the workers and doctors to treat them. These higher-class individuals expected comfortable accommodations in upscale residences and hotels, plenty of fashionable clothing and other fancy goods available for convenient purchase in expansive shops, and quality entertainment in their leisure time. So Mountain View, its present population nearly two thousand and rising daily, had four hotels, each two-story, with all rooms including glass windows and soft mattresses with clean linens. Town saloons offered fine mixed drinks&#x2014;sloe-gin fizzes were a popular choice. Traveling troupes of players passed through on a regular basis, presenting everything from Shakespeare to concerts of popular music to slapstick comedy. Saloons were currently used as makeshift theaters, but the Mountain View town council had plans to construct an honest-to-goodness performance venue soon.</p><p>Residents walked its streets in safety. A well-compensated police force stood constant guard against the thugs and grifters who plagued other thriving frontier towns. Word spread among territorial ne&#x2019;er-do-wells: Be smart. Stay away from Mountain View. And, mostly, they did.</p><p>Mountain View&#x2019;s informal lending library, conveniently located next door to a bank, comprised almost two hundred books. The town nine &#x201c;baseball&#x201d; team held regular practices; participants planned to test their skills at this newfangled sport under game conditions just as soon as an opponent in another community could be found. A bowling alley in the back of the Camp Feed Store provided additional opportunity for the recreation-minded. Proprietor Hope Camp was also the Mountain View mayor. In between resetting wooden pins by hand, he chatted with customers about the telegraph lines that had recently placed the town in instant communication with the outside world. With more silver strikes ï¿½reported in the area on a regular basis and three more full-scale mining operations soon beginning operations, Mountain View&#x2019;s potential was unlimited, and its pleasures already plentiful.</p><p>Yet Cash McLendon hated being there. The woman he loved was the reason.</p><p>Years earlier in St. Louis, McLendon had courted and won the heart of Gabrielle Tirrito, who ran a small general store with her immigrant father, Salvatore, in a downscale factory district. But when McLendon&#x2019;s employer, rich industrialist Rupert Douglass, offered him the opportunity to marry his daughter, Ellen, and eventually take over the Douglass empire, McLendon accepted. He&#x2019;d grown up as a poor orphan in the St. Louis slums, and the lure of wealth overcame him. Brokenhearted, Gabrielle moved with her father to the small prospecting community of Glorious in Arizona Territory. After Ellen&#x2019;s suicide, knowing her father would blame him, McLendon fled St. Louis with Patrick Brautigan on his heels. He made his way to Glorious, hoping to reconcile with Gabrielle, only to find her virtually engaged to Joe Saint, the soft-spoken town sheriff. Caught there by Brautigan, McLendon escaped with Saint&#x2019;s help. After many more months on the run, he ended up in Dodge City, Kansas, and was thrilled to learn that Gabrielle, now living with her father in Mountain View, had not yet married Saint. They exchanged letters and agreed that McLendon would come there; Gabrielle would allow him a final chance to change her mind. To pay for the trip, McLendon signed on to a buffalo hunt that ventured deep into Indian Territory. There, at an outpost called Adobe Walls, he fought in and miraculously survived an epic battle where thirty white men held off nearly a thousand Comanche, Cheyenne, and Kiowa. Chastened and matured by the bloody experience, McLendon used most of his money for train and stage passage to Mountain View, certain that he would win Gabrielle back from Joe Saint, who also lived there. But ten days after his arrival, it was obvious that he shouldn&#x2019;t have felt so sure. From the time Gabrielle greeted him with a hug and chaste kiss on the cheek more appropriate for an arriving cousin than a lover, things were awkward ï¿½between them. They weren&#x2019;t meeting as equals&#x2014;Gabrielle controlled their future, whatever it might be, and McLendon soon realized that she had no intention of making her decision quickly.</p><p>Gabrielle worked as the receptionist at the fashionable White Horse Hotel. It was managed by Major Mulkins, who had befriended McLendon back in Glorious. Mulkins generously offered McLendon a small room at no cost while he was in town and allowed McLendon to share the staff&#x2019;s free meals in the kitchen. Without any immediate financial concerns, McLendon could devote every waking minute to Gabrielle, but she had other ideas. Her work hours were long, from dawn to dusk on weekdays and half days on Saturday. Sunday mornings, she played piano during Catholic services held in the barn behind Tim Flanagan&#x2019;s Livery. During the services, Flanagan&#x2019;s horses and mules were tethered outside. Gabrielle&#x2019;s father, Salvatore, now ill and bedridden in the room the Tirritos shared on the hotel&#x2019;s second floor, occupied much of her attention. And when she was free, Gabrielle insisted on spending just as much time with Joe Saint as she did with McLendon.</p><p>&#x201c;All I promised you in my letters was a chance,&#x201d; she reminded McLendon when he complained. &#x201c;Joe is a wonderful man, and I enjoy his company. If you&#x2019;re so dissatisfied with my behavior, you&#x2019;re of course free to be on your way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I wouldn&#x2019;t even think of that,&#x201d; McLendon said quickly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m anxious. I&#x2019;ve been here for two weeks&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ten days. Don&#x2019;t exaggerate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ten days. And not once have you let me talk about my plans for us, or tell you again how sorry I am for all I&#x2019;ve done wrong. If you&#x2019;d only let me do that, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;d be persuaded.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What you&#x2019;re saying is, you want to make a fine speech,&#x201d; Gaï¿½brielle said. &#x201c;As we both know, I&#x2019;ve heard them from you before. There&#x2019;s no need for another. I accept that you&#x2019;re sorry. I realize that you&#x2019;ve changed.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle was on a mid-afternoon work break. She and McLendon strolled down the wooden sidewalk past the Camp Feed Store. From the far side of the building came the rattle of tumbling bowling pins. The wind whipped Gabrielle&#x2019;s long, dark hair into wild tendrils, and she reached up to pat them back into place. Most women in town wore scarves or wide-brimmed bonnets when they ventured outside, but Gabrielle rarely did. Her lustrous hair was one of her most striking features, and, rather than cover it up, she liked to accentuate it with brightly colored ribbons. &#x201c;For now I just want to talk about small things and get used to who you&#x2019;ve become,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Tell me more about your recent life in Dodge City. Collecting and selling buffalo bones sounds fascinating.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was tedious, and I always smelled bad from the stink on the bones,&#x201d; McLendon said. They reached the end of the sidewalk and paused in the shade of Flanagan&#x2019;s Livery. August was sweltering in northeast Arizona Territory. &#x201c;This can&#x2019;t really be interesting to you. There have to be better things to talk about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I am interested, and you should be pleased,&#x201d; Gabrielle said. &#x201c;Much of a life together would involve relatively minor details. If either of us already finds casual conversation with the other to be tedious, then we won&#x2019;t match up well in the long term.&#x201d;</p><p>McLendon sighed. &#x201c;Whatever you want, of course. But you have to understand&#x2014;I constantly feel that I&#x2019;m on trial with you. I&#x2019;m never certain what to say or do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t overthink it. I know this is hard on you, but it&#x2019;s difficult for me, too, and also for Joe. Simply by asking for the opportunity to make this choice, I&#x2019;m being unfair to him, after his years of love and loyalty. Look, there he is. School is letting out.&#x201d;</p><p>Two blocks down the hard-packed dirt street, a dozen children of varying ages ran gleefully from a one-room wooden shack that served as a schoolhouse during the week and a Protestant church on Sundays. Behind them, patting passing heads and calling out warnings to watch where they were going, was Joe Saint, thin to the point of emaciation, his thick-lensed spectacles and patchy beard adding to the overall impression of a human scarecrow. Saint had been named sheriff in Glorious because he was scrupulously honest and not at all capable of the casual brutality of many frontier lawmen. Prior to that, he&#x2019;d been a schoolteacher back East, and always hoped to return to the profession. As a growing community with aspirations of greatness, Mountain View wanted a school and a teacher, even though, as yet, only a handful of youngsters lived in town. Saint gladly took the job, and, for four dollars a day, the same rate that miners in town were paid, presided over students ranging in age from five to fourteen. Now, looking down the street, he saw Gabrielle waving, and waved back. McLendon took note and said to her, &#x201c;I guess I need to walk you back to the hotel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, there&#x2019;s still so much to do today. Every room we have is spoken for, and Major Mulkins says we might need to set up tents behind the building for the overflow. The other hotels are full up too. The town council is never happy to see tents because they think these detract from the town&#x2019;s image, but it&#x2019;s either that or turn away visitors who&#x2019;d spend money with local businesses. It&#x2019;s a good problem to have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose I&#x2019;ll move into the Major&#x2019;s room with him. He said I could, if you needed my room for a paying customer.&#x201d; Moving wouldn&#x2019;t require much effort on McLendon&#x2019;s part. He&#x2019;d lost all of his possessions at Adobe Walls and arrived in Mountain View with only his Colt Peacemaker and the clothes he was wearing. He used most of the few dollars that remained to him after travel costs to purchase another shirt, a pair of pants, socks, and drawers. Having no income bothered him; so did taking ongoing advantage of Mulï¿½kins&#x2019;s generosity. If Gabrielle took much longer deciding between him and Joe Saint, McLendon knew he would have to find work in&nbsp;town.</p><p>Outside the White Horse, McLendon asked Gabrielle, &#x201c;Will I see you tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, perhaps at dinner in the kitchen, if I can get away from the front desk. But afterward, Joe is escorting me to a poetry reading in the meeting room of the Eagle Hotel across the street.&#x201d; She nodded toward a&nbsp;building across the street. &#x201c;You could join us, but that might be uncomfortable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It would be,&#x201d; McLendon admitted. During his ten days in town, he and Saint had deliberately avoided each other. In all but one instance, their encounters were formal and polite, since Gabrielle was present and neither wanted to upset her. The single time they&#x2019;d passed on the street and Gabrielle wasn&#x2019;t around, McLendon nodded perfunctorily while Saint glared and didn&#x2019;t nod or speak at all.</p><p>Gabrielle started toward the door, then stepped back and put her hand on McLendon&#x2019;s forearm. &#x201c;I know this is wearing on you. I&#x2019;m sorry. I have to be certain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; McLendon said. &#x201c;Just decide when you can.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle smiled. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll find ways to amuse yourself tonight. Bowling? Reading a book from the library?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll stand the Major to a drink at one of the finer local establishments. I still have a few dollars in my pocket, not many, but enough for that. He&#x2019;s being so kind to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because he&#x2019;s glad to see you again,&#x201d; Gabrielle said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m gladder still.&#x201d; She took a quick look around, and then, assured no one was watching, leaned forward and kissed McLendon lightly on the lips. It was the first time she&#x2019;d kissed him since the cheek peck upon his arrival, and he was momentarily thrilled. But as Gabrielle disappeared inside, McLendon couldn&#x2019;t help wondering if she had already decided and was drawing out the suspense to make him suffer. It was, after all, human nature to savor revenge.</p><p>Major Mulkins sipped bourbon and sighed appreciatively. &#x201c;A good brand, this,&#x201d; he told McLendon. &#x201c;Jim Beam is what they call it. There was no such quality liquor back in Glorious, just raw ï¿½red-eye.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tonight there&#x2019;s fine whiskey and surroundings to match,&#x201d; McLendon agreed. He was glad to see the Major lingering over his bourbon, since the Jim Beam cost an appalling two bits a glass. Though McLendon had deliberately brought Mulkins to Mountain View&#x2019;s finest saloon to treat his friend to the best, he couldn&#x2019;t afford many fifty-cent drinks. &#x201c;There was never an establishment like this in Glorious either.&#x201d;</p><p>They were in the Ritz saloon. Businesses in the frontier frequently boasted names far more glamorous than the establishments themselves, but in this case it was apt. The Ritz was well lighted with oil lamps, allowing patrons to enjoy views of flocked wallpaper, mounted hunting trophies&#x2014;a ferocious grizzly raged in a particularly lifelike manner just inside the ornate swinging entrance doors&#x2014;and reasonably tasteful paintings depicting ï¿½attractive&nbsp;women with minimal clothing. Well-dressed businessmen seated in low-backed captain&#x2019;s chairs conversed at cloth-covered tables or else stood comfortably bent over their drinks at the long wooden bar, propping their well-shod feet on a footrail. Card games, poker and faro, were played in an adjacent room. Dice was forbidden at the Ritz&#x2014;it smacked of lower-class wagering. There were plenty of ashtrays and spittoons, all regularly emptied by bow-tied staff. Hostesses in low-cut gowns circulated, accepting drink orders and, discreetly, assignations in upstairs rooms. Only high-class, pox-free whores were permitted to ply their trade in the Ritz, and each paid a monthly tax to the town for the privilege.</p></b></p><h2>Feels Like Family (Sweet Magnolias, Book 3)</h2><p>Brand New hardcover</p><p></p><h2>Looker</h2><p>If the model is the exhibitionist, then I am the voyeur. Richard Kern<br><br>Richard Kern is a post-modernist punk photographer who has worked in New York city rock music and No Wave&#x201d; art circles since the 1970s. In <i>Looker</i>, through a series of carefully constructed vignettes, Kern&#x2019;s models proceed through their daily private lives, seemingly unaware of the camera. Or are they wittingly playing into the obvious cinematic intrigue? The balance of control present in each frame is a powerful and sensual statement.<br><br><i>Looker</i> is thought-provoking in its gentle nature, pastoral tones, and caring reflection of private innocence but it is also freshly and stunningly erotic, silently exuberant in its portrayal of intimacy and abandon.

His photographs have appeared in <i>ArtForm, i-D, Purple, PDN, Flash Art, FHM, GQ,</i> and <i>Legshow</i>. He lives in New York.<br><br>Geoff Nicholson has written fourteen novels, including <i>The Food Chain, Footsucker</i> and <i>Bleeding London</i>, which was shortlisted for the 1997 Whitbread Prize.<br>Underground filmmaker, music video director and photographer Kern (Action) has built the latter half of his career on documenting a kind of hipster porn aesthetic, and this latest book, his tenth, continues that trend, with glossy full-color images of women caught, seemingly unawares, in various stages of undress. At their best, the pictures here are simple and effective, as much about the play of light, atmosphere and composition as about any forced notions of sexuality. At their worst, they are simply cheesy. One, an obvious homage to the iconic 70s image of a female tennis payer scratching her butt, comes off as less sexy than clumsy and stale. As might be expected in a book that purports to be created on the fly, there's an abundance of public nudity and crotch shots here-perhaps one of Kern's particular fetishes-and most of the images are in soft focus, as if taken with telephoto lens from behind bushes and across fields. Kern prefers his models natural and disheveled; readers might welcome the lack of make-up and artifice in his photographs-assuming that the essential artifice of reconstructed voyeurism doesn't turn them off, that is. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In THE CRASH OF 2016, Thom Hartmann argues that the facade of our once-great United States will soon disintegrate to reveal the rotting core where corporate and billionaire power and greed have replaced democratic infrastructure and governance. Our once-enlightened political and economic systems have been manipulated to ensure the success of only a fraction of the population at the expense of the rest of us.<br><br> The result is a "for the rich, by the rich" scheme leading to policies that only benefit the highest bidders. Hartmann outlines the destructive forces-planted by Lewis Powell in 1971 and come to fruition with the "Reagan Revolution"-that have looted our nation over the past decade, and how their actions fit into a cycle of American history that lets such forces rise to power every four generations.<br><br> However, a backlash is now palpable against the "economic royalists"-a term coined by FDR to describe those hoarding power and wealth-including the banksters, oligarchs, and politicians who have plunged our nation into economic chaos and social instability.<br><br> Although we are in the midst of what could become the most catastrophic economic crash in American History, a way forward is emerging, just as it did in the previous great crashes of the 1760s, 1856, and 1929. The choices we make now will redefine American culture. Before us stands a genuine opportunity to embrace the moral motive over the profit motive-and to rebuild the American economic model that once yielded great success.<br><br> Thoroughly researched and passionately argued, THE CRASH OF 2016 is not just a roadmap to redemption in post-Crash America, but a critical wake-up call, challenging us to act. Only if the right reforms are enacted and the moral choices are made, can we avert disaster and make our nation whole again.<br><br></p><p>Thom Hartmann is an internationally syndicated talk show host heard by over 2.75 million listeners each week and simulcast on television in more than 40 million homes.

Now Father Andrew M. Greeley, one of America's most beloved storytellers, examines the parables told by Jesus in search of a fuller understanding of the man and his message.<br>This engaging and informal collection of homilies reveals a Jesus whose simple parables carry profound lessons about the Kingdom of Heaven. Along the way, Father Greeley touches on such provocative topics as the significance of Jesus's Jewish roots, his deep and revolutionary relationship with women, <i>The Da Vinci Code,</i> and <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>. He also singles out the four greatest parables, which best illustrate the infinite love and mercy of the God whose kingdom began with Jesus and continues even today.<br>As a storyteller, Jesus often surprised his listeners with unexpected twists that challenged them to see the world in a whole new light. Father Greeley's insightful tour of the Gospels provides a fresh look at the parables that strips away centuries of false and mistaken interpretations to get at the essential truth of who Jesus really was and what he believed.</p><p><p>Priest, sociologist, author and journalist, <b>Father Andrew M. Greeley</b> built an international assemblage of devout fans over a career spanning five decades. His books include the Bishop Blackie Ryan novels, including <i>The Archbishop in Andalusia</i>, the Nuala Anne McGrail novels, including <i>Irish Tweed</i>, and <i>The Cardinal Virtues</i>. He was the author of over 50 best-selling novels and more than 100 works of non-fiction, and his writing has been translated into 12 languages.</p><p>Father Greeley was a Professor of Sociology at the University of Arizona and a Research Associate with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. In addition to scholarly studies and popular fiction, for many years he penned a weekly column appearing in the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and other newspapers. He was also a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>National Catholic Reporter</i>, <i>America </i>and <i>Commonweal</i>, and was interviewed regularly on national radio and television. He authored hundreds of articles on sociological topics, ranging from school desegregation to elder sex to politics and the environment.</p><p>Throughout his priesthood, Father Greeley unflinchingly urged his beloved Church to become more responsive to evolving concerns of Catholics everywhere. His clear writing style, consistent themes and celebrity stature made him a leading spokesperson for generations of Catholics. He chronicled his service to the Church in two autobiographies, <i>Confessions of a Parish Priest</i> and <i>Furthermore!</i></p><p>In 1986, Father Greeley established a $1 million Catholic Inner-City School Fund, providing scholarships and financial support to schools in the Chicago Archdiocese with a minority student body of more than 50 percent. In 1984, he contributed a $1 million endowment to establish a chair in Roman Catholic Studies at the University of Chicago.

Hence we will never finish our search. We will never understand him. He is a man of surprises, appropriate for one who claims to witness a God of surprises. Thus, when we think we at last have figured him out, truly understand him, and can sign him up for our cause, we find that he has slipped away. When we are convinced that we can quote him in support of our own side in any argument, Jesus is out of here. The Jesus we have shaped to fit our ideas, our needs, our fears, may be a very interesting and special person, but he's no longer Jesus. We must begin our story of Jesus by granting him permission to surprise us endlesslyï¿½not that he needs our permission because he will surprise even without our permission.<br><br>Those who followed him in Palestine a couple of millennia ago were fascinated by his stories. They had heard most of them before, but he insisted on ending the stories with a disturbing twist, a disconcerting finale. Troubled and confused, they continued to follow him, if only to see what kind of outrageous paradox or contorted ending he would tell the next time. His good news indeed sounded good, perhaps too good to be true, but it didn't fit the expectations of his followers, even the closest followers. It disturbed them. He disturbed them.<br><br>If he doesn't disturb us, then he's not Jesus.<br><br>The disturbance begins at the beginning with the Christmas stories, those preludes to two of the Gospels that charm us today because we are so familiar with them, at the risk of losing strange, almost weird content of the stories.<br><b>&nbsp;<br>Chapter One: The Christmas Surprises<br></b><br><i>At that time Emperor Augustus ordered a census to be taken throughout the Roman Empire. When this first census took place, Quirinius was the governor of Syria. Everyone, then, went to register himself, each to his own hometown.<br><br>Joseph went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to the town of Bethlehem in Judea, the birthplace of King David. Joseph went there because he was a descendant of David. He went to register with Mary, who was promised in marriage to him. She was pregnant, and while they were in Bethlehem, the time came for her to have her baby. She gave birth to her first son, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a mangerï¿½there was no room for them to stay in the inn.<br><br>There were some shepherds in that part of the country who were spending the night in the fields, taking care of their flocks. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone over them. They were terribly afraid, but the angel said to them, "Don't be afraid! I am here with good news for you, which will bring great joy to all the people. This very day in David's town your Savior was born-Christ the Lord! And this is what will prove it to you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."<br><br>Suddenly a great army of heaven's angels appeared with the angel, singing praises to God: "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom he is pleased!"<br><br>When the angels went away from them back into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us."<br><br>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and saw the baby lying in the manger. When the shepherds saw him, they told them what the angel had said about the child. All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said.<br><br>Mary remembered all these things and thought deeply about them. The shepherds went back, singing praises to God for all they had heard and seen; it had been just as the angel had told them.<br></i><br><i>Luke 1:1-2<br></i><br>Two lovely stories, right? One needs only a Christmas tree, carols in the background, and softly falling snow (accumulation one inch or less, please) to create just the right atmosphere of sentimentality. We have perhaps seen so many Christmas cards during our lives that we are immune to the absolute weirdness of the nativity storiesï¿½an angel wanders into a hut in Nazareth and tells a very young woman (fifteen perhaps) that she is about to conceive a child of the Holy Spirit. The young woman, who is probably illiterate, asks how this is to be and then recites a complex poem steeped in the language of the Jewish Scriptures and makes the astonishing prediction that all nations will call her blessed. Whatï¿½s going on here?<br><br>Then she and her husband (who is not the child's father) go off on a difficult journey in the middle of winter (which is usually quite unpleasant in the mountains of Palestine) and the newborn babe is laid in a pile of straw in a cave somewhere. Then a crew of angels appears in the sky and praises the new babe, whom the shepherds dash over to inspect-shepherds, the absolute bottom of the Jewish social structure, dirty, smelly, rough, ignorant, and religiously unclean men. And what's this about the magicians? Jews were not supposed to believe in magic and certainly not in gentile magic. What's this all about? Is this a decent way for the expected of the nations, the anointed one, the messiah to come into the world? Is this not revisionism of the Prophets and vigorous revisionism at that?<br><br>The whole collection of Christmas stories in Matthew's and Luke's Gospels must be called bizarre, surprising indeed but strange, almost offensively so. We don't know where they come from, who wrote them, and how they found their way into the two Gospels. However, if we understand that the adult Jesus was also surprising, strange, disturbing, and also often more than a little weird, the nativity stories are good "trailers" (as they now call what we used to dub "previews of coming attractions") for the stories yet to come. If we could hear the Christmas stories as though we were hearing them for the first time, we would be shocked or at least awakened out of our usual boredom. This babe who was born in Bethlehem was likely to be one very odd man when he grew up.<br><br>Moreover, whoever put the stories together did so with a keen eye on the Jewish Scriptures and made allusions to passages in the Jewish Bible that only someone steeped in those books could have noted. Two questions arise immediately from our contemporary obsessions about literalism. Who wrote these tales and are they true? And a third question might be: why are the stories in Luke and Matthew so different?<br><br>In all probability the nativity stories floated, drifted around in the traditions of the followers of Jesus in the middle and late middle of the first century. Someone may have combined them into a catena of stories that was available to St. Luke and he appended them to his Gospel. Unless I am completely mistaken about Luke he was not unaware of the surprises crammed into the stories and how they foretold a lot more surprises from the adult Jesus.<br><br>Are they true? There was no video camera ready for the conversation between Mary and Gabriel, nor a stenographer, nor any witness at all. Are those the exact words they exchanged? Who knows? However, given the people involved and the matter at hand, there is a certain verisimilitude in the conversationï¿½at least till we get to the words of the Magnificat, which seem to be unlikely in the mouth of a young peasant woman, but perhaps not impossible. A virginal conception? That of course boggles the mind, though there can be no doubt that was what the author of the story and Luke who collated the story into his Gospel also believed. Such a belief must have existed among some Christians in the late middle years of the first century, so it will not do to claim that it is something that ï¿½the Churchï¿½ imposed in subsequent years. It is of course a scientific impossibility, which is why many Christians reject it today. In a closed universe such conceptions simply do not occur. Yet how closed is the universe?<br><br>Father Raymond Brown describes the infancy narratives as theologumenonsï¿½stories with a theological point. The author(s) of the narratives were teaching powerful theological truths through their narrativesï¿½the most powerful of which is that something utterly new happened with the coming of Jesus, something unexpected, confounding, disorienting, and monumentally surprising: the birth of a new creation or a rebirth of the old (same thing), not only news, but exorbitantly good news. If one can accept that truth then the possibility of a virginal conceptionï¿½or a resurrectionï¿½should seem no big deal. Those who are so eager to reject a virginal conception never seem to pay any attention to the beginning of a new creation, the birth of a second Adam. Either Jesus was what he said he was or he was not. If he was, then there was a special intervention outside the human system (the nature of which we do not understand). If he was not, then his whole story is either fraud or self-deception. Those who would remove from the Jesus story the wondrous, the marvelous, the miraculous, the incredible surprise, destroy the story altogether.<br><br>The Christmas stories are either superstitious, if beautiful, nonsense or they tell us something critically important about the babe and about the man he would grow up to be.<br><br>The infancy stories of great men of the ancient world are usually spectacular. Signs and portents abound. The Jesus stories, however, are almost drab by comparison. One angel and one maiden, a visit to a cousin who is also miraculously pregnant, a journey to Bethlehem, angels on a hillside, shepherds and magicians, a lost boy in Jerusalem, all rather commonplace. One or two miraculous interventions, but certainly in a low key. Some poetic outbursts that seem a little excessive-how dare this girl child claim that she will be praised by all future generations, a prediction that must have seemed excessive to the collector of the story and perhaps to Luke himself.<br><br>She was right, of course.

The five men who came together in the Russian capital of St. Petersburg in the 1860s, all composers of talent, some of genius, would be&#x2014;in spite of a virtual lack of technical training&#x2014;responsible for some of the greatest and best-loved music ever written. How this happened is the subject of Stephen Walsh's brilliant composite portrait of the group known in the West as the Five, and in Russia as <i>moguchaya kuchka</i>&#x2014;the Mighty Little Heap. Friends, competitors, and creative intellectuals whose ambitions and ideas reflect the ferment of their times, Mily Balakirev, Cï¿½sar Cui, Alexander Borodin, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, and&#x2014;most important of all&#x2014;Modest Musorgsky, come wonderfully to&nbsp; life in this extended account.<br><br>The detail is engrossing. We see Borodin composing music while conducting research in chemistry (&#x201c;he would jump up and run back to the laboratory to make sure nothing had burnt out or boiled over there, meanwhile filling the corridor with improbable sequences of ninths or sevenths&#x201d;); Balakirev tutoring Musorgsky (&#x201c;Balakirev could not remedy the defects in his pupil&#x2019;s character, but he could confront him with works of genius&#x201d;); Cui doggedly producing operas during breaks from his career as a military fortifications instructor. Musorgsky asserts his independence, moving from writing songs and the showpiece <i>Night on Bald Mountain </i>to the magnificent<i> Boris Godunov, </i>meanwhile struggling against poverty and depression. In the background such important figures as Vissarion Belinsky and Nikolay Chernï¿½shevsky shape the cultural milieu, while the godfather of the <i>kuchka,</i> critic and scholar Vladimir Stasov, is seen offering sometimes combative support. <br><br>As an experienced and widely skilled musical scholar and biographer (his two-volume life of Stravinsky has been called &#x201c;one of the best books ever written about a musician&#x201d;), Stephen Walsh is exceptionally wellplaced to tell this story. He does so with deep understanding and panache, making <i>Musorgksy and His Circle</i> both important and a delight to read.</p></p><p>Stephen Walsh is a professor of music at Cardiff University and the author of a number of books on musical subjects. He was deputy music critic of <i>The Observer</i> for nearly twenty years. He now broadcasts frequently on BBC Radio 3 and writes reviews for a variety of publications. His two-volume <i>Stravinsky</i> is regarded as the standard biography of that composer. The first volume won the Royal Philharmonic Society prize in 2000, and the second was named one of the ten best books of 2006 by <i>The Washington Post.</i>*Starred Review* Few influential artistic friendships have had more participants, lasted longer, or been more consequential than that of five Russians who stormed the heights of Western music in the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Though Mily Balakirev, Aleksandr Borodin, Cï¿½sar Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov did have predecessors&#x2014;principally Mikhail Glinka&#x2014;in building a truly Russian art music, they put it on its feet despite lack of musical education beyond piano tutoring anywhere in Russia (only Rimsky-Korsakov had academic training), of career paths for musicians in Russia, and of encouragement by Russian elites. As the title of Walsh&#x2019;s brilliant volume signals, the greatest of these composers is now considered to be Mussorgsky, whose work was so structurally unusual for its time that most of it wasn&#x2019;t performed as he wrote it until the later twentieth century. In absorbing dicusssion of virtually every bit of his production, Walsh argues that Mussorgsky invariably chose emotional expression and the rhythms of Russian speech rather than the rules of classical form to shape his music, outstandingly in his 60 songs and transcendent opera, Boris Godunov. Walsh discusses the most ambitious works of the other four musical friends with similar penetration as he unfolds the life and career trajectories of all five, constantly bedeviled by lack of time to compose and shortage of venues for performance. A masterpiece of Russian cultural history. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Believe in the God Who Believes in You</h2><p>Presents a practical guide to living as a Christian in the modern world, based on the Ten Commandments</p><p></p><h2>Heidi, Student Study Guide</h2><p>Children who are asked to read slightly above their comfort level will develop into superior readers.

While foreign affairs have become the central issues of her chancellorship in this crucial election year, the entire world is anxiously looking to&nbsp;Germany to play its part in Europe's rescue. From her youthful days of hitchhiking in Tbilisi to being the guest of honor&nbsp;at a White House state dinner,&nbsp;this book&nbsp;examines how a girl from East Germany rose to the highest echelons of European power. As well as explaining how Angela Merkel's world view was shaped and influenced by her background and ideology,&nbsp;this lively account discusses her personal relations with international counterparts such as David Cameron, Barack Obama,&nbsp;and Vladimir Putin, as well as her attitude towards the countries and cultures over which they rule.</p><p><b>Stefan Kornelius</b> is head of the foreign policy department of <i>Sï¿½ddeutsche Zeitung</i>, the largest German national subscription daily newspaper. He met Merkel for the first time in 1989 in East Berlin when she was the Speaker of the Democratic Awakening.

After years working as a foreign correspondent in Washington, Kornelius returned to Berlin 1999&#x2014;just in time for the CDU funding scandal and Merkel's rise to the head of CDU party.

Here Petronius brilliantly brings to life the courtesans, legacy-hunters, pompous professors and dissolute priestesses of the age and, above all, Trimalchio, the archetypal self-made millionaire whose pretentious vulgarity on an insanely grand scale makes him one of the great comic characters in literature. Seneca&#39;s The Apocolocyntosis, a malicious skit on the deification of Claudius the Clod&#39;, was designed by the author to ingratiate himself with Nero, who was Claudius&#39; successor. Together, the two provide a powerful insight into a darkly fascinating period of Roman history.</p><p>For this edition Professor Sullivan has updated his translation and his invaluable literary and historical introductions in the light of the latest research; he has also included all Petronius&#39; surviving verse.<b>Titus Petronius Arbiter</b> is reputedly the author of the&nbsp;<i>Satyricon</i>. According to Tacitus, Petronius' chief talent lay in the pursuit of pleasures, in which he displayed such exquisite refinement that he earned the unofficial title of the emperor Nero's 'arbiter of elegance' (<i>arbiter elegantiae</i>). Court rivalry and jealousy contrived to cast on Petronius the suspicion that he was conspiring against the emperor, and he was ordered to commit suicide in A.D. 66. He gradually bled to death, opening his veins, binding and re-opening them, passing his last hours in social amusement and the composition of a catalogue of Nero's debaucheries.<br><br><b>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</b>, statesman, philosopher, advocate and man of letters, was born at Cordoba in Spain around 4 BC. He rose to prominence in Rome, pursuing a career in the courts and political life, for which he had been trained, while also acquiring celebrity as an author of tragedies and essays. Falling foul of successive emperors (Caligula in AD 39 and Claudius in AD 41), he spent eight years in exile, allegedly for an affair with Caligula&#x2019;s sister. Recalled in AD 49, he was made praetor and was appointed tutor to the boy who was to become, in AD 54, the emperor Nero. On Nero&#x2019;s succession, Seneca acted for some eight years as an unofficial chief minister. The early part of this reign was remembered as a period of sound government, for which the main credit seems due to Seneca. His control over Nero declined as enemies turned the emperor against him with representations that his popularity made him a danger, or with accusations of immorality or excessive wealth. Retiring from public life he devoted his last three years to philosophy and writing, particularly the&nbsp;<i>Letters to Lucilius</i>. In AD 65 following the discovery of a plot against the emperor, in which he was thought to be implicated, he and many others were compelled by Nero to commit suicide. His fame as an essayist and dramatist lasted until two or three centuries ago, when he passed into literary oblivion, from which the twentieth century has seen a considerable recovery.</p><h2>Injury Time</h2><p>Edward is throwing a dinner party with Binny , his mistress.

Things are a little awkward to begin with - a late start and him having to be away by half past ten - but everything seems to be going well.

A rare inside look at the evolution of the world's leading classical publisher and how it works with composers to shape music history. Rather than wage a price war, Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes decided to merge their rival businesses in 1930. Signing Bartok and Strauss and investing in talented young composers like Britten and Copland, the company fully came of age with the acquisition of masterpieces by Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff, and Prokofiev. The 1980s saw a new flowering, with impressive signings in America and Europe, but not without internal struggles. Distinguished journalist and broadcaster Helen Wallace vividly charts the company's progress through boom years and unexpected financial threats, and reveals how artistic foresight has been balanced with commercial reality. "A surprisingly gripping narrative. For those who wonder what really goes on in music publishing, it offers a fascinating read."

I&#x2019;d been dreaming&#x2014;-rich colors, shapes, and places&#x2014;-but couldn&#x2019;t remember all the details. It didn&#x2019;t matter. I climbed out of bed and shuffled down the hallway. Rachel Swenson sat in an armchair by the front windows. The pup was asleep in her lap.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>She turned, face paled in light from the street, eyes a glittering reflection of my grief and guilt. &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That dog can sleep anywhere.&#x201d; I pulled a chair close. Maggie slipped an eye open, yawned, stretched, and went back to sleep.<br><br>&#x201c;I should be staying at my place,&#x201d; Rachel said.<br><br>&#x201c;I like you here.&#x201d;<br><br>She tickled two bandaged fingers across the top of the pup&#x2019;s head and ran her eyes back toward the windows. Rachel was a sitting judge for the Northern District of Illinois. And one of the finest people I knew. She was also damaged. Because she was my girlfriend. Or, rather, had been.<br><br>&#x201c;I was going to make a cup of tea,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You want one?&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head. I stayed where I was. And we sat together in the darkness.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t sleep?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Dreams.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded, and we sat some more.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the knife for, Rach?&#x201d;<br><br>She looked down at the knife tucked into her left hand. &#x201c;I got it from the kitchen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>Her gaze drifted to a small table and the slab of cheese that sat on it. &#x201c;You want a piece?&#x201d;<br><br>I shook my head. She held the blade up between us. &#x201c;You thought I was going to hurt someone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just wondering about the knife, Rach.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; It had been almost a month since the attack. Most of the swelling in her face was gone&#x2014;-the bruises reduced to faint traces of yellow.<br><br>&#x201c;What did you dream about?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;I usually don&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Usually?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes I get premonitions. Twice before. I wake up and feel certain things have happened.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If they&#x2019;ve already happened, they&#x2019;re not premonitions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you going to make your tea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me about them,&#x201d; she said, cutting off a small slice of cheese and nibbling at a corner.<br><br>&#x201c;The dreams?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The premonitions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got the first one when my brother died.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Philip?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was seventeen. Woke up in the middle of the night and walked out to our living room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I sat in front of the phone and stared at it for ten minutes until it rang. The warden told me he&#x2019;d killed himself. Hung himself in a cell with his bedsheet. But it wasn&#x2019;t anything I didn&#x2019;t already know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Second time was a couple years back&#x2014;-the night my father died.&#x201d;<br><br>I remembered my eyes opening, tasting the old man&#x2019;s passing like dry dust at the back of my throat. I pulled out the whiskey that night and filled a glass. Then I sat by the phone again until it rang.<br><br>&#x201c;And now?&#x201d; Rachel said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the thing. I&#x2019;m not sure this time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe so, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>She got up from the chair and settled the pup on the couch. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make the tea.&#x201d;<br><br>I listened to her rattle the tap in the kitchen, then set the kettle. I got up and pulled a book off the shelf, Thucydides&#x2019;s History of the Peloponnesian War. It took me a moment to find the passage. Book 2, chapter 7. The historian&#x2019;s description of the Plague of Athens.<br><br>All speculation as to its origin and its causes . . . I leave to other writers, whether lay or professional; for myself, I shall simply set down its nature, and explain the symptoms by which perhaps it may be recognized by the student, if it should ever break out again. This I can the better do, as I had the disease myself, and watched its operation in the case of others.<br><br>I thought about Thucydides, surrounded by death, touched himself, scribbling down its essence for us to read twenty--four hundred years later. I&#x2019;d lied to Rachel. I knew what I feared. Knew why I feared it. I closed my eyes and they were there&#x2014;-two lightbulbs hanging in the darkness of the Chicago subway. Inside their glass skin, a question mark. Something the old historian himself might struggle to decipher.<br><br>The kettle began to whistle. On cue, the phone rang. Rachel watched from the doorway as I picked up. It wasn&#x2019;t a voice I expected to hear. And that was exactly what I expected. I listened without saying more than a word or two. Finally, the voice stopped talking&#x2014;-waiting, apparently, for a reaction.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; I said. The voice told me.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there in an hour.&#x201d; I hung up. Rachel looked like she might speak, then turned away. Maggie was awake now and staring at me from the couch.<br><br>&#x201c;You want breakfast?&#x201d;<br><br>The pup&#x2019;s ears perked up at the last word. I walked toward the kitchen. She beat me there by the length of the living room.<br><br>&#x201c;Was it what you thought?&#x201d; Rachel handed me a mug of tea.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>I fed the dog. We both listened to her crunch away and then lick the bowl clean.<br><br>&#x201c;I have to go out,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be here when you get back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rach . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop.&#x201d; She raised her arm and touched her hand to her face, as if I were about to hit her. Then she turned and left. The pup followed. I walked back into the bedroom and got dressed. When I returned to the living room, Rachel was curled up on the couch.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll talk to you later,&#x201d; I said. She didn&#x2019;t respond. I was going to say more, but recalled the lessons of saying too much. So I left.<br><br>It was still dark out as I tramped down Addison. The first streaks of morning stained the Chicago night&#x2014;-fresh paint on an old canvas. Underneath, a city slept. Everywhere, it seemed, except in my dreams. And the dreams of those I cared about.</p><h2>The Flying Inn: A Novel</h2><p><p>The beloved G.K.

In fact, there is nothing too absurd in this satirical work for it not to have actually taken place recently. . . .

The first beaver she spotted at the lily-covered pond in Harriman State Park (N.Y.) was a huge male who appeared every evening to inspect the 150-foot dam; he was followed by a female and two kits. Ryden observed the family for four years, recording their activities and noting births, deaths, departures and a major move. Inevitably, she became involved with the animals--bringing food during a severe winter, helping the beavers save the dam when a vandal destroyed it, hand-feeding the feeble old matriarch in her final days. Ryden, who found beavers to be intensely social and highly intelligent, discusses the animals' importance in the ecosystem as they leave one pond and build another dam elsewhere. This is captivating natural history. Illustrations not seen by PW. First serial to Readers Digest; BOMC and QPB alternates. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.This is a diary of observations by naturalist/writer Ryden. This type of coverage can be interesting and enlightening, but Ryden is trying to pass it off as research. For example: Because there was no evidence of aspen by the pond, she assumes (wrongly) that these beavers have never tasted it, while beavers, in fact, do move beyond their home sites. Ryden is not satisfied to observe; she interferes, particularly when she feeds the beavers when she assumes that they need her help.

Brand new comprehensive science curriculum.</p><p></p><h2>The Mystery of Economic Growth</h2><p><p>Far more than an intellectual puzzle for pundits, economists, and policymakers, economic growth--its makings and workings--is a subject that affects the well-being of billions of people around the globe. In <i>The Mystery of Economic Growth</i>, Elhanan Helpman discusses the vast research that has revolutionized understanding of this subject in recent years, and summarizes and explains its critical messages in clear, concise, and accessible terms.</p><p>The tale of growth economics, as Helpman tells it, is organized around a number of themes: the importance of the accumulation of physical and human capital; the effect of technological factors on the rate of this accumulation; the process of knowledge creation and its influence on productivity; the interdependence of the growth rates of different countries; and, finally, the role of economic and political institutions in encouraging accumulation, innovation, and change.</p><p>One of the leading researchers of economic growth, Helpman succinctly reviews, critiques, and integrates current research--on capital accumulation, education, productivity, trade, inequality, geography, and institutions--and clarifies its relevance for global economic inequities. In particular, he points to institutions--including property rights protection, legal systems, customs, and political systems--as the key to the mystery of economic growth. Solving this mystery could lead to policies capable of setting the poorest countries on the path toward sustained growth of per capita income and all that that implies--and Helpman's work is a welcome and necessary step in this direction.</p></p><p>Elhanan Helpman is the Galen L. Stone Professor of International Trade at Harvard University.&#x201c;Professor Helpman's analytic powers and extraordinary grasp of the subject make his book, <i>The Mystery of Economic Growth</i>, the most comprehensive analysis of economic growth to date. The wide variety of relevant issues, from technological development through price and income causes and consequences to institutional changes are made available to the scholar and the interested general reader. The evaluations of different strands are judicious and wise, as well as highly representative of the literature.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kenneth Arrow, Nobel Laureate in Economics</b><br><br>&#x201c;Want to understand the latest and best thinking on economic growth?

Each page shines with profound knowledge, erudition, and wisdom.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrei Shleifer, co-author of <i>The Grabbing Hand: Government Pathologies and Their Cures</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this book, Elhanan Helpman reviews and analyzes economic growth, by pointing out the importance of input accumulation, trade, inequality, innovation, productivity, and institutions. He uses the most basic concept to outline what we know, what we do not know, and what we ought to know about the subject on a comprehensive and understandable manner. Such an approach should enable even noneconomists to become involved in the "growth mystery" without resorting to complex mathematical formulations...Overall, the book is well written, and the author is indeed highly knowledgeable on the issue at hand and his views are quite insightful and helpful in our understanding of economic growth, along with providing encouragement to developing countries.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Masiiwa Rusare</b><b>, </b><b><i>Developing Economies</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Mystery of Economic Growth</i> is the book to read if you want to learn about what we know about "economic growth" and what the remaining mysteries are.

Tour.</p><p>Rivers's exuberantly hip, sexually freewheeling autobiography displays his relentless, almost exhibitionistic candor, as some of his paintings do. Born Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg in 1923, he was raised in the Bronx by a hypercritical mother and a father reportedly guilty of bizarre sexual improprieties with children. A bebop jazz saxophonist with a heroin habit, Rivers abandoned his first wife and their sons in 1947. He later married his Welsh housekeeper, a "deliciously unique female"; they separated in 1968. Written with playwright-director Weinstein, this gossipy collage dissects the incestuous social world of a New York avant-garde that included John Ashbery, Helen Frankenthaler, Kenneth Koch, Andy Warhol, LeRoi Jones and Delmore Schwartz. Rivers is most emotive when discussing his "romantic fling" with poet Frank O'Hara.

Clarke Award winner for Best Novel, Pat Cadigan is the Queen of Cyberpunk for the brilliance of her ideas, the genius of her near-future extrapolations, and the beauty of her writing. No one else has explored and illuminated the mind-machine interface with the keen and relentless intelligence she demonstrates in her novels <i>Mindplayers</i>, <i>Synners</i>, <i>Fools</i>, and the long-awaited <i>Tea from an Empty Cup</i>. Her fourth novel is a perceptive, fascinating, witty SF mystery of artificial reality, whose paradoxical name perfectly defines its nature: an immaterial world of pure sensation, where, by legal mandate, everything is permitted and nothing is forbidden.<p> The hazards of Artificial Reality are spilling into the real world--people vanish and solitary gamers are found slain in sealed AR booths. The young woman Yuki, child of a Japan destroyed before her birth, enters AR as the new assistant to the mysterious celebrity Joy Flower, but with her own agenda: to find Tom Iguchi, her missing beloved, who never was her lover but had been one of Joy's Boyz. The hard-boiled homicide detective Dore Konstantin stalks the virtual streets of post-Apocalyptic Noo Yawk Sitty seeking a serial killer who may have murdered eight gamers from inside AR itself. But how do you find missing or hidden persons in a world where nothing is as it seems? The two plot lines subtly converge as fact and fantasy, murderer and victim, as well as understanding and identity invert in a virtual universe where the dangers are real and ever-present, and you can be anything or anyone but yourself. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Near/medium-future cyberpunk yarn from the author of the paperback Fools (1992), etc., and numerous well-known stories. Artificial Reality is indistinguishable from external reality; all enthusiasts and addicts need to enter it is a ``hotsuit'' and a helmet. Police Lieutenant Dore Konstantin investigates a DOA found in an AR parlor; the victim is a 17-year-old Caucasian with a messily cut throat. In AR he called himself Shantih Love, or perhaps Tom Iguchi, though he wasn't Japanese; his favored scenario was post-Apocalyptic Noo Yawk Sitty - wherein, Konstantin discovers, eight deaths have occurred in as many months. There were no witnesses, and nobody was seen to enter or leave the booth where the boy died. Meanwhile, Yuki, a full-blooded Japanese (Japan itself has been destroyed), attempts to locate her mysteriously vanished boyfriend, Tom Iguchi. She meets Tom in Noo Yawk Sitty, but he's trapped somehow in AR; worse, someone else is experiencing everything she experiences, wearing her just as she wears the hotsuit supplied by shady AR facilitator Joy Flower. Konstantin, though a novice and completely out of her depth, is also forced to enter AR in order to develop new information. She borrows the Shantih Love ID, complete with cut throat, and eventually learns that the enigmatic Body Sativa knows everything that's going on in AR. A parlor employee, it emerges, was supplying drugs to clients, enabling them to ``speed'' up to the higher levels of AR enjoyed by clubbers, manipulators, and various wannabes. Poor Yuki, meanwhile, finds she has become Joy Flower's slave. Konstantin will find it perplexing to sort out the swirl of motives and multiple identities, or even distinguish AR from reality. The murder mystery's well constructed and often absorbing - but AR is no different from VR, and the intractable problem remains: when anything can happen, how is it possible to care when something does? -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Davies</h2><p>This is an autobiography that describes what it was like to be a tramp in the late 19th century in North America. From the preface: "I HASTEN to protest at the outset that I have no personal knowledge of the incorrigible Super-tramp who wrote this amazing book. If he is to be encouraged and approved, then British morality is a mockery, British respectability an imposture, and British industry a vice. Perhaps they are: I have always kept an open mind on the subject; but still one may ask some better ground for pitching them out of window than the caprice of a tramp. I hope these expressions will not excite unreasonable expectations of a thrilling realistic romance, or a scandalous chronicle, to follow. Mr. Davies&#x2019; autobiography is not a bit sensational: it might be the Post Office Directory for the matter of that. A less simple minded supertramp would not have thought it worth writing at all; for it mentions nothing that might not have happened to any of us. As to scandal, I, though a most respectable author, have never written half so proper a book.</p><p>W. H. Davies (1871-1940) was a renowned Welsh poet, most famous for his poem Leisure (1911). He published his first book, The Soul&#39;s Destroyer and Other Poems in March 1905. He wrote few works of prose; Autobiography of a Super-Tramp (1908) is his most famous. He married in 1923 and his last place of residence was Nailsworth, Gloucestershire. In 1926 he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Wales. In 1938 a plaque in his honour was unveiled in Newport.&#x201c;Davies and Kerouac are so similar it&#x2019;s like they have had the same illness. !ey kept searching, longing, moving. . . !ey are mesmerising narrators. . . [Davies&#x2019;s] story has the tension and suspense of a man whose life and soul is in jeopardy.&#x201d; <br><br><i>The Times</i> (London)</p><h2>The Lost Art of Gratitude: An Isabel Dalhousie Novel</h2><p><b><br><br> <b>ISABEL DALHOUSIE - Book 6<br></b><br> <b>Nothing captures the charm of Edinburgh like the bestselling Isabel Dalhousie series of novels featuring the insatiably curious philosopher and woman detective.&nbsp; Whether investigating a case or a problem of philosophy, the indefatigable Isabel Dalhousie, one of fiction&#x2019;s most richly developed amateur detectives, is always ready to pursue the answers to all of life&#x2019;s questions, large and small.</b><br><br></b> Isabel&#x2019;s son, Charlie, is now of an age&#x2014;eighteen months&#x2014;to have a social life, and so off they go to a birthday party, where, much to Isabel&#x2019; s surprise, she encounters an old adversary, Minty Auchterlonie, now a high-flying financier. Minty had seemed to Isabel a woman of ruthless ambition, but the question of her integrity had never been answered. Now, when Minty takes Isabel into her confidence about a personal matter, Isabel finds herself going another round: Is Minty to be trusted? Or is she the perpetrator of an enormous financial fraud?

He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and has served on many national and international bodies concerned with bioethics.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Chapter One<br><br>IT WAS WHILE she was lying in bed that Isabel Dalhousie, philosopher and editor of the Review of Applied Ethics, thought about the things we do. Isabel was a light sleeper; Charlie, her eighteen-month-old son, slept deeply and, she was sure, contentedly; Jamie was somewhere in between. Yet Isabel had little difficulty in getting to sleep. Once she made up her mind to sleep, all that she had to do was to shut her eyes and, sure enough, she would drift off. The same could be done if she surfaced in the course of the night or in those melancholy small hours when both body and spirit could be at their lowest ebb. Then all she had to do was to tell herself that this was not the time to start thinking, and she would quickly return to sleep.<br><br>She had wondered about the causes of her light sleeping and had spoken about it to a friend, a specialist in sleep disorders. She had not consulted him professionally, but had brought the matter up over dinner; not before the whole table, of course, but in the intimacy of the one-to-one conversation that people have with those sitting beside them.<br><br>"I don't like to ask about medical things," she said.<br><br>"But . . . ," he said.<br><br>"Well, yes. But. You see, you doctors must dread being buttonholed by people who want to talk about their symptoms. There you are at a party and somebody says: I've been having these twinges of pain in my stomach . . ."<br><br>"Have you?"<br><br>"No, I haven't."<br><br>He smiled. "The old clichï¿½, you know. Somebody comes and says, A friend of mine has this rash, you see, and I wondered what it was. That sometimes happens. Doctors understand all about embarrassment, you know."<br><br>Isabel nodded. "But it must annoy you&#x2014;being asked about medical matters."<br><br>He thought for a moment. "<i>Nihil humanum mihi alienum est</i>, if I may lapse into Latin. I don't set my mind against anything human. Doctors should subscribe to that, I think. Like priests."<br><br>Isabel did not think the comparison quite fitting. "Priests <i>do</i> disapprove, don't they? Doctors don't&#x2014;or shouldn't. You don't shake your head over your patients' behaviour, do you?"<br><br>"If doctors see self-destructive behaviour, they might," he said. "If somebody comes in with chronic vascular disease, for example, and you smell the nicotine on his fingers, of course you're going to say something. Or a drinker comes in with liver problems. You're going to make it clear what's causing the problem."<br><br>"But you don't ladle on the blame, do you? You don't say things like, This is all your own stupid fault. You don't say that, even if it patently is his stupid fault."<br><br>He played with his fork. "No, I suppose not."<br><br>"Whereas a priest will. A priest will use the language of right and wrong. I don't think doctors do that." She looked at him. He was typical of a certain type of Edinburgh doctor; the old-fashioned, gentle Scottish physician, unmoved by the considerations of profit and personal gain that could so disfigure medicine. That doctors should consider themselves businessmen was, Isabel had always felt, a moral tragedy for medicine. Who was left to be altruistic? Teachers, she thought, and people who worked for charities; and public-interest lawyers, and . . . in fact, the list was quite long; probably every bit as long as it ever had been. One should be careful, she told herself, in commenting on the decline of society; the elder Cato was the warning here&#x2014;a frightful old prig, he had warned that everything was in decline, forgetting that once we reach forty we all believe that the world is on the slide. Only if eighteen-year-olds started to say <i>O tempora! O mores</i>! would the situation be really alarming; eighteen-year-olds did not say that, though; they no longer had any Latin, of course, and could not.<br><br>"You were going to ask me a question," he said. He knew Isabel, and her digressions, her tendency to bring philosophical complications into the simplest of matters.<br><br>"Why are some people light sleepers?" she began, and added hurriedly, "I'm one, by the way."<br><br>"So am I, as it happens," he replied. "It's often respiratory&#x2014;sleep apnoea, where you keep waking up because you're choking. If not, it may be an idiosyncrasy of the brain. Is it a problem?"<br><br>"Not for me. Not really. I go back to sleep."<br><br>He nodded. "You could get yourself checked for sleep apnoea. It's pretty easy to monitor sleep patterns. You don't look at risk to me, though&#x2014;it tends to affect heavier people."<br><br>That had been the end of the conversation, as another guest had addressed the table at large and private conversations had trailed off. But now, lying in bed, in one of these brief periods of nocturnal wakefulness that she had decided were the product of brain idiosyncrasy rather than breathing problems, Isabel turned and looked at the sleeping form of Jamie beside her. She still experienced a sense of novelty, even if they had been together for a couple of years now; a sense of having been given a precious gift. And he felt it too; he had expressed it that way, too, when he told her that he was grateful for her. "I feel that I've been given something," he said. "Somebody has given me you. Isn't that odd? Because it doesn't happen that way, does it?" She watched him breathing. The sheet that he had drawn up to his chest and that lay crumpled about him like a Roman toga moved almost imperceptibly, but still moved. The act of breathing was not really an act at all, as the will played no part. We did not tell ourselves to breathe&#x2014;except sometimes, in yoga classes and the like&#x2014;and when we were asleep, as Jamie was now, the system itself remembered to do what was required. And how many of the other things we did fell into that category?<br><br>Isabel wondered what a detailed record of our day's activities would look like&#x2014;not a record of the sort that might appear in a diary: <i>Went into town. Had lunch</i>. That kind of thing gave a broad-brush account of what we did but did not list the really particular, the hundreds&#x2014;tens of thousands probably&#x2014;of little actions in a person's day. We did such things all the time: tiny movements of the limbs as we sat in a chair or lay in bed, as she did now; little twitches, the flickering of the eyelids, the touching of the fingers, the inclining of the head. Those were nothing really&#x2014;background noise, one might say&#x2014;but they would all be religiously entered in this record of the day. And then there were the things we said&#x2014;the speech acts, as philosophers called them&#x2014;which ranged from the <i>ums</i> and <i>ers</i>, the muttered phrases of apology on bumping into somebody in a crowd, the meaningless expressions that lubricated our social dealings with one another. A transcript of our speech over the space of a day would make sobering reading, Isabel thought; and over a lifetime? What would we have said? What would it amount to? How much energy would we have wasted on the smallest of small talk; how many months would be filled with sheer nonsense?<br><br>And then, as often as not, when the time came to talk, really to talk, we were tongue-tied, as could happen to people at the bedsides of the dying, when there was an urgency that cried out for big things to be said, and we found that we could say very little, or that tears made it impossible to speak. Isabel remembered once visiting an aunt on her father's side who did not have long to live; she had wanted to thank her for her generosity to her as a girl, and although she had managed to say the words that expressed her gratitude, the aunt, known for her coruscating wit, had simply said, "Flattery will get you everywhere," and later that afternoon had died. But at least she had been thanked. "Flattery will get you everywhere" were memorable last words, if indeed the aunt had said nothing more after Isabel left her bedside, which she thought was probably the case. It would be a perfectly presentable final sentence, although not as witty, perhaps, as Oscar Wilde's gazing in dismay at the decoration surrounding his deathbed and saying, by way of farewell, "Either that wallpaper goes or I do."<br><br>If a transcription of our day's speech would make uncomfortable reading, how much more dismaying, perhaps, would be a record of our thoughts. For a moment she imagined how it would look. A mixture of memories, fleeting and prolonged, what-if speculations, idle observations, regrets&#x2014;that would be its shape for most of us, and for most of us, too, the leitmotiv would be . . . Isabel paused, unwilling to reach a conclusion so solipsistic, but unable to avoid it: the leitmotiv would be me. It was that simple. Most of us, most of the time, were thinking about ourselves.<br><br>But was that really bleak, or just human? We were, after all, ourselves; that was all we really knew, and the only point from which we could act. We could think of others, of course, and did, but such thoughts were often about others in the context of ourselves&#x2014;what they had said to us, what they had done to us.<br><br>She looked at Jamie, who stirred.<br><br>"Jamie," she whispered. She had not intended to, but did. She uttered his name, as if to confirm the fact that he was there; we named things and they became more real.<br><br>He stirred again. A person's name is the one thing he hears even in sleep.<br><br>"So . . . ," he muttered drowsily.<br><br>"Are you awake?" Isabel whispered.<br><br>"Am now . . . ," although his eyes were still shut.<br><br>"Sorry," she said. "I won't talk to you any more."<br><br>He reached out a hand. There was a three-quarters moon outside and an elongated rectangle of light came in through the chink in the curtains. She would have to replace those curtains; Grace, her housekeeper, had been going on about that for years now. "Those curtains, they're ancient, Isabel, and the lining has rotted, you know."<br><br>She gazed at Jamie's forearm in the moonlight; flesh made silver. She took his hand in hers and held it lightly. She wanted to cry, from sheer happiness, but he would really wake up if he...</p><h2>Penny Pinching Mama 500 Ways I Lived on $500 a Month</h2><p>Book by Jill Cooper</p><p></p><h2>Wednesday</h2><p><p><i>Wednesday</i> is a sweet story about two best friends, Little Round and Big Square.

She&#x2019;d been strolling down the street&#x2014;her first time strolling, mind you, but it had felt like the right thing to do in the small town&#x2014;when a hand had suddenly shot out of Hot Buns Bakery, curled around her arm, and yanked her inside the oh-so-precious pink-and-white establishment.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Mac pressed good-naturedly, pushing the brim of her Stetson back off her forehead. &#x201c;Thoughts? I need them. Normally I have them. But today, for some reason, it&#x2019;s just blank upstairs.&#x201d;</p><p>A smile touched Sheridan&#x2019;s lips. She really liked Mackenzie Byrd. The dark-haired, blue-eyed, ever-grinning forewoman of the Triple C Ranch was funny and smart and took no shit from anyone&#x2014;male or female&#x2014;which was an attribute Sheridan wholeheartedly admired. In fact, in another life, where Sheridan didn&#x2019;t work for the man she worked for, she and Mac might&#x2019;ve been friends. But she did work for Deacon, and friendship wasn&#x2019;t something she allowed herself to invest in. Either with time or her emotions. She&#x2019;d grown up, maybe even hardened, watching her mother invest so deeply in her father&#x2019;s happiness and career only to be destroyed when he&#x2019;d walked out on them. Determined to never risk her heart, she&#x2019;d looked at all relationships as a distraction to her schooling, her work, and her goals. Sometimes it got lonely. But Sheridan would always choose loneliness over destruction.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all excellent,&#x201d; she offered in a professional tone.</p><p>Mac groaned and held her fork above her head, the tines stained with bits of frosting. &#x201c;I know. But which one is the best?&#x201d;</p><p><i>Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate</i>. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s really for you to decide, Miss Byrd.&#x201d;</p><p>Dropping back in her chair, Mac&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;Sheridan, seriously, you can&#x2019;t call me that. We&#x2019;ve talked about this.&#x201d;</p><p>The small smile that had touched Sheridan&#x2019;s lips a moment ago expanded into a full-fledged grin. She couldn&#x2019;t help it. She liked this woman. &#x201c;You and Mr. Cavanaugh are engaged. I am his employee. In my very corporate world, there&#x2019;s no fraternizing with the boss&#x2019;s family. Or those who are soon to be family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh Lord have mercy,&#x201d; Mac said with an eye roll.</p><p>&#x201c;And forgive me for saying so, Miss Byrd,&#x201d; Sheridan continued, &#x201c;but isn&#x2019;t this something you should be doing with Mr. Cavanaugh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As you very well know, Deacon&#x2019;s in Dallas for the next couple of days. This needs to get done.&#x201d; A slight wickedness flashed in her blue eyes. &#x201c;And as his right hand, his most trusted employee&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh dear.&#x201d;</p><p>Mac laughed. &#x201c;Come on, you know what he likes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As do you, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s abandoned me in my time of need, Sheridan,&#x201d; Mac said dramatically. &#x201c;This wedding is less than three weeks away, and things like cake and flowers and food need to be decided on. Am I supposed to make all the decisions alone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe some women would find that a blessing, Miss Byrd.&#x201d; <i>I know I would</i>. &#x201c;Total control of the remote, so to speak.&#x201d;</p><p>Mac snorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not that kind of woman, Sheridan. Now, if we&#x2019;re having beef for the fancy dinner, that I can pick out and drive right on over to the butcher.&#x201d; She paused for a moment as Hot Buns&#x2019;s head baker sidled up to their table and set a sizable piece of coconut cake between them.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow, Natalie,&#x201d; Mac exclaimed, taking in the layers and the fluffy white coconut. &#x201c;This looks amazing. I&#x2019;ll never decide.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you should call off the wedding, then?&#x201d; Natalie replied softly.</p><p>Both Mac and Sheridan glanced up at the dark-eyed woman, who was somewhere around Mac&#x2019;s age.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry; what did you say?&#x201d; Mac asked, confused.</p><p>Natalie looked sheepish. Her eyes pinned to the table, she ran her hand through her short blond hair, which was cut in a cute pixie style. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m kidding. Of course.&#x201d; She swallowed tightly, then turned around and walked back toward the kitchen.</p><p>Sheridan stared after her. &#x201c;Strange woman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep. Even back when we were in school,&#x201d; Mac remarked. &#x201c;But she makes a mean doughnut. And a killer pumpkin-spice cupcake. And, of course, regular cake. She&#x2019;s a bakery genius.&#x201d;</p><p>Turning to face the forewoman once again, Sheridan laughed. &#x201c;Well, then, she&#x2019;s excused. Geniuses are exempt from normality. You know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she could help you with your wedding plans. A school friend might be just the thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Natalie isn&#x2019;t a friend,&#x201d; Mac clarified. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t back when we were in school either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Then maybe someone from the Triple C&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My closest friend is Blue.&#x201d; Sobering, she released a heavy sigh. &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s run away from home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; While she didn&#x2019;t know the details of the newest Cavanaugh brother&#x2019;s exit to parts unknown, Sheridan knew enough to be sympathetic. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about that. I know you two are very close.&#x201d;</p><p>Mac&#x2019;s eyes went kitten-wide. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say you&#x2019;re sorry. Say you&#x2019;ll be my wingman.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman was relentless. &#x201c;Miss Byrd&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mac,&#x201d; she corrected.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re really stubborn, you know that?&#x201d;</p><p>She snorted. &#x201c;Hell yes, I know. Part of my charm.&#x201d; She wiggled her eyebrows. &#x201c;And this no-fraternizing-with-the-boss&#x2019;s-relatives business ain&#x2019;t gonna work anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; Sheridan said, her gaze flickering traitorously toward the coconut cake. She loved coconut cake. Made a pretty decent one herself. Maybe strange-genius Natalie could teach her a thing or two. &#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, James won&#x2019;t like you calling him <i>Mr</i>. Cavanaugh when he&#x2019;s kissing on you now, will he?&#x201d;</p><p>Heat slammed into Sheridan&#x2019;s cheeks, and the entire bakery seemed to shrink around her. &#x201c;Wh-what?&#x201d;</p><p>Dipping her fork into the coconut cake, Mac&#x2019;s grin widened. &#x201c;Oh, come on, Sheri.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Sheri?</i> And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>James</i>? KISSING ON HER? What the hell was happening? This town and several of its residents were getting to her, making her appear soft. Making her forget why she had come to River Black. Work. For her boss, Deacon Cavanaugh. To further her career. Not to forge friendships or get caught up in dramas, imaginings, or, for God&#x2019;s sake, wedding plans!</p><p>Sitting up just a little bit straighter, Sheridan said in her most controlled voice, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to work, Miss Byrd. I&#x2019;m not dating anyone. Especially not James. Er&#x201d;&#x2014;she cleared her throat&#x2014;&#x201c;Mr. Cavanaugh.&#x201d;</p><p>To be fair, she had noticed James Cavanaugh. Frankly, one would have to be blind not to. The man was decidedly handsome and rugged. He worked with horses, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, and knew his Shakespeare. That was a serious quadruple threat. But professionalism demanded that noticing was as far as it went. No dating. No kissing.</p><p>As she studied Sheridan, Mac slid another forkful of coconut cake into her mouth. &#x201c;So, what you&#x2019;re saying is, he hasn&#x2019;t asked you out?&#x201d;</p><p>Good Lord. <i>Grant me patience</i>. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying anything,&#x201d; Sheridan answered quickly and with the slightest hitch of irritation. &#x201c;And of course he hasn&#x2019;t asked me out.&#x201d;</p><p>But instead of picking up on the frustration, Mac looked utterly perplexed. &#x201c;Really? I mean, how is that possible? I swear, whenever you&#x2019;re around, the guy can&#x2019;t keep his eyes off you, or his tongue inside his mouth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; Sheridan said tightly. But she couldn&#x2019;t stop the foolish and juvenile voice inside her that was already wondering if it were. Lord, if Deacon were to ever think she was interested in his brother, her position could be jeopardized. And she&#x2019;d worked way too hard to endanger her career&#x2014;not to mention her heart&#x2014;over a rugged horse-whispering man with a pretty face.</p><p>A <i>very</i> pretty face, her inner voice persisted.</p><p>Sheridan mentally rolled her eyes at herself.</p><p>Thankfully, something caught Mac&#x2019;s attention out the window and she turned away. &#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; she said in a near-purr. &#x201c;Speak of the devil.&#x201d;</p><p>Sheridan followed her line of vision and promptly forgot her middle name. <i>What was it? Dorie? Donna?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Holy cripes,&#x201d; Mac said, shaking her head. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got one of the mustangs out. Is he nuts? Riding that stallion down Main Street like he was a tame little pony driving to Sunday service.&#x201d;</p><p>Sheridan&#x2019;s pulse jumped and her skin tightened around her muscles. <i>Delilah?</i> <i>Danielle? Oh, that was it. Sheridan Danielle</i>. Her eyes widened. A man was riding down the street atop a very rebellious-looking black-and-white horse. No. Not a man. A cowboy. No. Not a cowboy. The <i>hottest</i> cowboy she&#x2019;d ever seen in her life. Probably the hottest cowboy in existence. Dressed in jeans and a black thermal, pieces of his brown hair peeking out from under a black Stetson, James Cavanaugh kept strict command over the snorting, frustrated animal beneath him. Not by being big and loud and cruel, but with that quiet, confident strength he always seemed to possess. Quiet confidence. It was one of the things about him that intrigued her&#x2014;and one of the things that would remain a tightly held secret from the woman seated across from her, if she wanted to keep her job secure and the probing questions to a minimum.</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like he&#x2019;s in the process of breaking that stallion,&#x201d; Mac observed, chin lifted, eyes narrowed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard about his work, but I&#x2019;ve never seen him in action. Quite a sight, eh, Sheri?&#x201d;</p><p>Sheridan was just about to tackle the &#x201c;Sheri&#x201d; issue when James Cavanaugh turned to look in the direction of the bakery and caught her staring at him out the picture window. As heat infused every cell of her body, Sheridan held his gaze. For a heartbeat, or maybe two, she forgot everything else around her. Including that pesky truth about her work and her employer. All she saw was James Cavanaugh&#x2019;s gorgeous blue eyes. They were probing, hypnotizing. And suddenly, completely without her permission, her hand lifted and she gave him a small wave. Which he acknowledged with a clipped nod, then turned back to the mustang and continued down the street.</p><p>Unnerved, Sheridan blinked and the world came back into focus. What was that? she wondered, turning to face Mackenzie once again, her cheeks flaming and her breathing uneven. What had just happened? And god, what had she done? The wave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the staring&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;That was a beautiful animal,&#x201d; she managed to push out from her dry throat. Then she quickly clarified, &#x201c;the mustang.&#x201d;</p><p>Amusement glittered in Mac&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re his passion&#x2014;that&#x2019;s for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>Passion. It wasn&#x2019;t a word Sheridan wanted her mind to associate with James Cavanaugh. Too late, mocked the foolish and juvenile voice inside her.</p><p>&#x201c;So, is that why he&#x2019;s staying in River Black?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;To care for them?&#x201d;</p><p>Mac shrugged. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot of reasons, I&#x2019;m sure. Dealing with Everett&#x2019;s will. The wedding. And there might be some new information about Cass&#x2019;s passing.&#x201d;</p><p>The sudden yet soft heat in Mac&#x2019;s voice gave Sheridan something solid to focus on. Cass was not only Deacon&#x2019;s and James&#x2019;s sister, but she had been Mac&#x2019;s best friend. Sympathy rolled over the lingering unease James Cavanaugh had ignited within Sheridan.</p><p>&#x201c;But I &#x2018;spect with the mustangs on Triple C land, James&#x2019;ll be here for quite a while. I hope so anyway.&#x201d; Mac&#x2019;s eyes connected with Sheridan&#x2019;s again and they were ripe with more questions. &#x201c;For everyone&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;</p><p>Sheridan eased back her chair, placed her napkin on the table, and got to her feet. She tried not to think about how unsteady her legs felt or why that would be. She&#x2019;d allowed way too much today. Discussing Deacon&#x2019;s brother, the staring, the waving&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;I should get back to the office.&#x201d;</p><p>Mac picked up her fork again and started in on the last few bites of coconut cake. &#x201c;Which one are you in today?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Town. But I&#x2019;ll be heading out to the ranch in the afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. Maybe I&#x2019;ll see you there.&#x201d; She shrugged. &#x201c;I want to take another look at the spot we may use for the ceremony.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure whatever you decide will be lovely, Miss Byrd.&#x201d;</p><p>Sheridan turned to go, but Mac grabbed her hand. &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;</p><p>Preparing to be scolded once again for the formality, Sheridan turned back.</p><p>Mac was chewing her lip. She looked sheepish. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;m sorry. I know you&#x2019;re here to work. Deacon&#x2019;s your boss and you don&#x2019;t want any problems with that. I&#x2019;m being a pushy jackass.&#x201d;</p><p>Sheridan gave the woman an easy, but decidedly professional smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no problem. And, Miss Byrd, I&#x2019;m here for whatever you need.&#x201d; She slipped her hand out of Mac&#x2019;s grasp and turned and headed for the door. But halfway there, she paused and glanced back. Professionalism was one thing, but truth in bakery goods was another. &#x201c;I think the coconut cake would be the perfect choice.&#x201d;</p><p>Mac looked surprised, and she called back, &#x201c;But you didn...</p></p><h2>The Use and Abuse of Literature</h2><p><p>As defining as Christopher Lasch&#x2019;s <i>The Culture of Narcissism,</i> Allan Bloom&#x2019;s <i>The Closing of the American Mind,</i> and Dinesh D&#x2019;Souza&#x2019;s <i>Illiberal Education</i> were to the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, respectively, Marjorie Garber&#x2019;s <i>The Use and Abuse of Literature</i> is to our times.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even as the decline of the reading of literature, as argued by the National Endowment for the Arts, proceeds in our culture, Garber (&#x201c;One of the most powerful women in the academic world&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i>) gives us a deep and engaging meditation on the usefulness and uselessness of literature in the digital age. What is literature, anyway? How has it been understood over time, and what is its relevance for us today? Who are its gatekeepers? Is its canonicity fixed? Why has literature been on the defensive since Plato? Does it have any use at all, or does it merely serve as an aristocratic or bourgeois accoutrement attesting to worldly sophistication and refinement of spirit?&nbsp; Is it, as most of us assume, good to read literature, much less study it&#x2014;and what does either mean?<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>The Use and Abuse of Literature</i> is a tour de force about our culture in crisis that is extraordinary for its brio, panache, and erudition (and appreciation of popular culture) lightly carried.

Kenan, Jr., Professor of English and of Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard University, and chair of the Program in Dramatic Arts. She has served as director of the Humanities Center at Harvard, chair of the department of Visual and Environmental Studies, and director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. A member of the Board of Directors of the American Council of Learned Societies and a trustee of the English Institute, she is the former president of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes, and a continuing member of its board. She is the author of sixteen books and has edited seven collections of essays on topics from Shakespeare to literary and cultural theory to the arts and intellectual life, including <i>Shakespeare After All,</i> which was acclaimed as one of <i>Newsweek&#x2019;</i>s ten best nonfiction books of 2004 and received the 2005 Christian Gauss Award from the Phi Beta Kappa Society.<p><i>Introduction </i><br>&nbsp;<br>At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the National Endowment for the Arts reported a disturbing drop in the number of Americans who read &#x201c;literary&#x201d; works. Drawing upon responses to the 2002 Census survey, which had asked more than seventeen thousand adults whether they had read any novels, short stories, poetry, or plays in their leisure time, the NEA noted that 45 percent said they had read some fiction, 12 percent had read some poetry, and only 4 percent had read a play. These findings, published in <i>Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America,</i> showed an alarming decline of reading in all age groups across the country, and especially among eighteen-to twenty-ï¿½four-year-olds. The chairman of the NEA termed the results an indiï¿½cation of a &#x201c;national crisis,&#x201d; one that reflected &#x201c;a general collapse in advanced literacy,&#x201d; and a loss that &#x201c;impoverishes both cultural and civic life.&#x201d;1 <br>&nbsp;<br>##<br><br>Among the report&#x2019;s &#x201c;10 key findings&#x201d; were that under half of the adult American population now reads literature; that although women read more than men (&#x201c;Only slightly more than one-third of adult Ameriï¿½can males now read literature&#x201d;), reading rates were declining for both men and women; that reading among persons at every level of education, including college graduates and postgraduates, had declined over the past twenty years; and that &#x201c;literary reading strongly correlates other forms of active civic participation,&#x201d; including volunteer and charity work, cultural involvement with museums and the performing arts, and attendance at sporting events. It was less surprising to find that compeï¿½tition with other modes of information, like the Internet, video games, and portable digital devices, had a negative effect upon the number of adults who regularly read.2 Race and ethnicity seemed not to be crucial factors: the rates of decline included whites, African Americans, and Hispanics. &#x201c;Listening&#x201d; to literature counted as a kind of reading for this survey, although watching films did not: women are more likely to listen to novels or poetry than men, whites more likely to listen to book readï¿½ings, African Americans most likely to listen to poetry readings. Here the report suggests that &#x201c;in part&#x201d; the reason may be &#x201c;the popularity of dub and slam poetry readings in the U.S.&#x201d;3 <br>&nbsp;<br>The idea that fiction/nonfiction should be the determining category for &#x201c;literary/nonliterary&#x201d; is spelled out in a brief section called &#x201c;Literaï¿½ture vs. Books,&#x201d; in which &#x201c;literature&#x201d; is explicitly defined as including &#x201c;popular genres such as mysteries, as well as contemporary and classic literary fiction. No distinctions were drawn on the quality of literary works.&#x201d;4 So a work of &#x201c;literature&#x201d; for the purposes of respondents to this survey could be a Harlequin romance or a Sidney Sheldon novel but not Gibbon&#x2019;s <i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,</i> or Machiavelli&#x2019;s <i>The Prince,</i> or David McCullough&#x2019;s biography of Harry Truman. I can understand why the survey wanted to make some kind of distinction, and I agree with the democratic decision not to judge works on their putative &#x201c;quality&#x201d; (which, in any case, a longer historical view would show is likely to change over time). But the decision to exclude &#x201c;nonficï¿½tion,&#x201d; or what an older tradition once dubbed &#x201c;intellectual prose,&#x201d; does seem to undercut a little the message that &#x201c;anyone who loves literature or values the cultural, intellectual, and political importance of active and engaged literacy in American society will respond to this report with grave concern.&#x201d;5 <br>&nbsp;<br>##<br><br>There was a time when the word <i>literature</i> meant an acquaintance with &#x201c;letters&#x201d; or books&#x2014;the confident possession, that is, of humane learnï¿½ing and literary culture. &#x201c;He had probably more than common literaï¿½ture,&#x201d; wrote Dr. Johnson about the poet John Milton. &#x201c;His literature was unquestionably great. He read all the languages which are considï¿½ered either as learned or polite&#x201d;6 Although Milton <i>wrote </i>great literature, that is not what Johnson&#x2019;s sentence says. It says that he <i>had</i> literature, which is to say learning, a familiarity with and understanding of words and texts. The nineteenth-century novelist Maria Edgeworth uses <i>litï¿½erature </i>in a similar way, describing &#x201c;A woman of considerable informaï¿½tion and literature.&#x201d;7 This sense of the word is now generally obsolete, and would, as is the fate of such obsolescences, undoubtedly be regarded as an error if used in the same way today. For example, if I were to write that J. M. Coetzee &#x201c;had great literature,&#x201d; any copy editor would immeï¿½diately &#x201c;correct&#x201d; my phrase to say that Coetzee <i>wrote</i> great literature. The new meaning, the only meaning current in departments and proï¿½grams of literature, is this: <br>&nbsp;<br><i>Literary productions as a whole; the body of writings produced in a particular country or period, or in the world in general. Now also in a more restricted sense, applied to writing which has claim to considï¿½eration on the ground of beauty of form or emotional effect. </i>(Oxford English Dictionary 3a.)<i> </i><br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s worth noting that the first instance of this use of the term given in the historical dictionary of the English language is comparatively recent&#x2014;1812&#x2014;hundreds of years after Chaucer and Shakespeare (and, of course, thousands of years after the Greek and Latin &#x201c;classics&#x201d;). Thus, over the centuries in England, the U.S., and indeed in France, &#x201c;literaï¿½ture&#x201d; has changed from a personal attribute or characteristic (something one <i>has</i>) to an institution and a product (something one <i>writes</i> or <i>knows</i>). <br>&nbsp;<br>Concurrent with this development was the emergence of a personage called a &#x201c;man of letters,&#x201d; whose profession was the production of literary work, whether or not he&#x2014;or, latterly, she&#x2014;actually earned a living by writing. Here is Sir Walter Scott, one of the most financially successful of nineteenth-century novelists: &#x201c;I determined that literature should be my staff, but not my crutch, and that the profits of my literary labour . . . should not . . .&nbsp; become necessary to my ordinary expenses.&#x201d;8 For Scott, literature was a product of &#x201c;labour&#x201d; and produced &#x201c;profits&#x201d; of a pecuniï¿½ary as well as of a more rarefied kind. Despite his disclaimer, he speaks here as a professional man. <br>&nbsp;<br>At the same time that a specifically high-cultural sense of literature was coming into currency, what we might call the general case of <i>literaï¿½ture</i> as meaning any body of writing on a given subject (&#x201c;the scientific literature&#x201d;) was developing, again concurrent with the establishment of academic and technical disciplines, each of which was supported and buttressed by specialist publications that came to be called a &#x201c;literature.&#x201d; And below that, if we might speak for a moment in terms of cultural hierarchy, was the most general case of all, the equation of <i>literature</i> with all printed matter. It&#x2019;s instructive to see the sequence of examples offered by the <i>OED</i> for what it still calls a colloquial usage: <br>&nbsp;<br><i>1895: &#x201c;In canvassing, in posters, and in the distribution of what, by a profane perversion of language, is called &#x2018;literature.&#x2019; &#x201d;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>1900: &#x201c;A more judicious distribution of posters, and what is termed &#x2018;literature.&#x2019; &#x201d;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>1938: &#x201c;It is some literature from the Travel Bureau.&#x201d;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>1962: &#x201c;Full details and literature from: Yugoslav National Tourist Office.&#x201d;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>1973: &#x201c;I talked my throat dry, gave away sheaves of persuasive literature.&#x201d;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Where, at the end of the nineteenth century, this use of the term was deemed profane and perverse, and thus encased in scare quotes, by the late twentieth century (the citation is from a 1973 crime novel by Dick Francis), the word <i>literature</i> no longer needed parsing or protecting and was routinely used to describe flyers, brochures, and other disposable printed stuff. <br>&nbsp;<br>##<br><br>So the meanings of <i>literature</i> as a term have, perhaps paradoxically, moved both &#x201c;up&#x201d; and &#x201c;down&#x201d; in recent years. On the one hand, it now seems to denote a particular reading, writing, and publishing practice associated with middle to high culture, with the notion of a literary canon, and with English majors; on the other hand, it has been co-opted&#x2014;or universalized&#x2014;so that it means just about anything professional&#x2014;or research-based&#x2014;written in words. <br>&nbsp;<br>In the pages that follow I will attempt not only to argue for but also to invoke and demonstrate the &#x201c;uses&#x201d; of reading and of literature, not as an instrument of moral or cultural control, nor yet as an infusion of &#x201c;pleaï¿½sure,&#x201d; but rather as a <i>way of thinking.</i> That is why, in my view, it is high time to take back the term <i>literature.</i> To do so will mean explaining why reading&#x2014;not skimming for information or for the plot (or for the sexy, titillating &#x201c;good parts&#x201d; of a novel or a political exposï¿½)&#x2014;is really hard to do; and why the very uselessness of literature is its most profound and valuable attribute. The result of such a radical reorientation of our understanding of what it means to read, and to read literature, and to read in a &#x201c;literary&#x201d; way, would be enormous. A better understanding of these questions is the only way to return literature to the center, rather than the periphery, of personal, educational, and professional life. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Literature Then and Now </i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>The word <i>literary</i> does not appear in Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s <i>A Dictionary of the English Language </i>(1755). Though based on the substantive <i>literaï¿½ture,</i> which&#x2014;as we&#x2019;ve seen&#x2014;itself originally meant &#x201c;humane learning,&#x201d; <i>literary</i> evolved, from the eighteenth century to the present, as someï¿½thing between a compliment and an epithet. Like other, similar concepts and terms, this one changed as its context changed. From the qualiï¿½tative categories of &#x201c;literary merit,&#x201d; &#x201c;literary reputation,&#x201d; and &#x201c;literary education&#x201d; (all eighteenth-century usages) to the social and economic realms of &#x201c;literary dinner,&#x201d; &#x201c;literary lunch,&#x201d; &#x201c;literary circle,&#x201d; &#x201c;literary agent,&#x201d; and &#x201c;literary executor&#x201d; (all hallmarks of twentieth-and twenty-first-century culture), the uses and fortunes of <i>literary</i> have fluctuated and either evolved or devolved depending upon one&#x2019;s view. When fewer persons were literate in the most basic sense, that is, able to read, a perï¿½son of literature or literary training was a prized, if undercompensated, member of society (Oliver Goldsmith: &#x201c;A man of literary merit is sure of being caressed by the great, though seldom enriched&#x201d;).9 <br>&nbsp;<br>The nineteenth century made celebrities of some of its writers. Dickï¿½ens and Wilde toured triumphantly in America, while &#x201c;Longfellow . . . largely paid the poet&#x2019;s penalty of being made the lion of all the drawï¿½ing rooms.&#x201d;10 (A characteristic modern version of this &#x201c;lionization&#x201d; is a handbook called <i>Sleeping with Literary Lions</i>&#x2014;which, despite its title, is not a hookup service but a guide to U.S. bed-and-breakfasts located near literary landmarks.) Today novelists and poets are read and praised, but by a smaller subsection of the population, since they now compete with films, television, the Internet, and other modes of cultural leisure. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;America&#x2019;s favorite book,&#x201d; according to a Harris poll that sampled just over 2,500 people, is, unsurprisingly, the Bible. As the proponents of the Butler Act in the famous Scopes trial controversy about evolution learned, not everyone will agree about what the Bible is, but let us put that question aside for a moment. The second favorite for men is <i>The Lord of the Rings;</i> the second favorite for women, <i>Gone with the Wind. </i>Others in the top ten include J. K. Rowling&#x2019;s Harry Potter books, Steï¿½phen King&#x2019;s <i>The Stand,</i> Ayn Rand&#x2019;s <i>Atlas Shrugged,</i> Dan Brown&#x2019;s <i>The Da Vinci Code,</i> Harper Lee&#x2019;s <i>To Kill a Mockingbird,</i> and J. D. Salinger&#x2019;s <i>The Catcher in the Rye.</i>11 <br>&nbsp;<br>Even with a tiny sample, this is a dispiriting list, suggesting that after high school (where <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> and <i>The Catcher in the Rye </i>remain on required reading lists), what used to be known as &#x201c;canonical literature&#x201d; is nowhere in sight. <br>&nbsp;<br>##<br><br>But what is the use of literature? Does it make us happier, more ethical, more articulate? Better citizens, better companions and lovers? Better businesspersons, better doctors and lawyers? More well-rounded individuals? Does it make us more human? Or simply human? Is what is being sought a kind of literary Rolodex, a personal <i>Bartlett&#x2019;s Familiar Quotations</i> of apt literary references (&#x201c;To be or not to be?&#x201d; &#x201c;Only conï¿½nect&#x201d;; &#x201c;Do I dare to eat a peach?&#x201d;)&#x2014;phrases that can be trotted out on suitable occasions, at the dinner table, or on the golf course? Such literary taglines or touchstones were once a kind of cultural code of mutual recognition among educated people&#x2014;but their place has long been taken by references from fi lm, video, TV, rock music, advertising, or other modes of popular culture. Is literature something that everyone should study in the same way that we should study other basic cultural facts about the world we live in, like the history of art or the history of music, studying them all in one fell swoop, in survey courses or general introductions or appreciations? <br>&nbsp;<br>Why read literature? Why listen to it on audiotapes or at poetry slams or at the theater? Why buy it? And even if you enjoy reading literature, why <i>study</i> it? <br>&nbsp;<br>What do we mean by <i>literature</i> today, when the term is used by mediï¿½cal and technical professionals to mean &#x201c;instructional brochures&#x201d; and by social scientists to mean &#x201c;a survey of academic research&#x201d;? &#x201c;Please send me the latest literature on your new headache drug&#x201d; or &#x201c;your most recent software&#x201d; or &#x201c;your latest cell phone.&#x201d; &#x201c;Enclosed you will find a review of the literature on gender discrimination in higher education.&#x201d; Indeed, the relationship between <i>literature </i>and <i>litter,</i> though not etyï¿½mologically correct, seems seductively close. (This homology, in fact, occurred to Jacques Lacan, who attributed it to James Joyce.)12 Literaï¿½ture is, all too often, pieces of paper we should consult for expertise but often simply toss in a drawer or in the trash. <br>&nbsp;<br>To overschematize a little for the sake of argument, let us say that there are two poles in the debate over the &#x201c;use&#x201d; or &#x201c;value&#x201d; of literaï¿½ture. One pole is utilitarian or instrumental: the idea that literature is good for you because it produces beneficial societal effects: better citiï¿½zens, for example, or more ethically attuned reasoners. The other pole might be characterized as ecstatic, affective, or mystical: the idea that literature is a pleasurable jolt to the system, a source of powerful feeling that&#x2014;rather like Judge Potter Stewart&#x2019;s famous pronouncement about pornography&#x2014;is unmistakable even if undefinable. (For Stewart&#x2019;s &#x201c;I know it when I see it,&#x201d; we could substitute &#x201c;I know it when I read it / hear it.&#x201d;) Emily Dickinson&#x2019;s &#x201c;If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry&#x201d; is perhaps the best-known expression of this view. It&#x2019;s worth quoting the longer passage from which this sentence ...</p></p><h2>Bonnard: Colour Library</h2><p>Bonnard is acknowledged as a master of modern art, following in the tradition of the Impressionists.

Analysing the particular temperament of Venetians, as well as its waterways, its architecture, its bridges, its tourists, its curiosities, its smells, sounds, lights and colours, there is scarcely a corner of Venice that Jan Morris has not investigated and brought vividly to life.<br><i><br></i>Jan Morris first visited the city of Venice as young James Morris, during World War II. As she writes in the introduction,"it is Venice seen through a particular pair of eyes at a particular moment - young eyes at that, responsive above all to the stimuli of youth." <i>Venice</i> is an impassioned work on this magnificent but often maddening city.<br><i></i></p><p>Jan Morris was born in 1926 of a Welsh father and an English mother, and when she is not travelling she lives with her partner Elizabeth Morris in the top left-hand corner of Wales, between the mountains and the sea. Her books include <i>Coronation Everest</i>, <i>Venice</i>, <i>The Pax Britannica Trilogy </i>(<i>Heaven's Command</i>, <i>Pax Britannica</i>, and <i>Farewell the Trumpets</i>), and <i>Conundrum</i>. She is also the author of six books about cities and countries, two autobiographical books, several volumes of collected travel essays and, more recently, the unclassifiable <i>Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere</i>. <i>A Writer's World</i>, a collection of her travel writing and reportage from over five decades, was published in 2003. <i>Hav, </i>her novel, was published in a new and expanded form in 2006 and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Her most recent book, <i>Contact!, </i>about the people she encountered on her many travels, was published in 2009.Here, revised and introduced by the author, is Jan Morris&#39;s portrait of La Serenissima, published 50 years ago and still without equal. She cherishes every cranny: the city&#39;s 3,000 alleyways, its jails, its waterways and its buildings decaying like &#39;dukes in threadbare ermine&#39;. She presents its past, its art and its language, which Byron called &#39;sweet bastard Latin&#39;. A suitably respectful narration - with an Italian flourish. - Rachel Redford, The Observer If you are going to Venice this summer, and even if you are not, Jan Morris&#39;s Venice makes excellent listening. Newly revised, it is introduced by the 84-year-old Morris herself, then the dulcet voice of Sebastian Comberti takes over narration. It opens historically but takes in architecture, culture, practicalities (the boats of the fire, police and ambulance services, the rubbish collectors who are slowly creating a whole new island) and the mysteries of death. Morris fell in love with Venice when there during the Second World War, and her accumulation of memories is heartfelt, personal, quirky and enlightening. Perfect for a leisurely approach by Eurostar and night train to Venice, but just as good for whiling away the dull hours commuting to work. - Christina Hardyment, The Times &#39;I was in my 20s when I wrote this,&#39; says Morris in the introduction to her best known travel book, &#39;and I like to think that its faults are the heady faults of youth.&#39; What faults? Fifty years on, it is still the best all-round guide to a city that, despite the ever-present hordes of tourists, remains the most magical destination on earth. Listening to this equally magical audio made me long to go back and check out all those less touristy bits that so enthralled young Morris - the alley too narrow for Browning to open his umbrella, the crypt allegedly containing Mary Magdalen&#39;s finger, the fish market &#39;laden with sleek wriggling eels, still pugnaciously alive, beautiful little red fish packed in boxes like shampoos, heads upwards ... soft bulbous octopus furiously injecting ink ... a multitude of sea matter ... sliding, sinuous, shimmering, flabby, spongy, crisp, all lying aghast upon their fresh green biers dead, doomed or panting like a grove of brilliant foliage among the tundra of Venetian stone.&#39; Yes, the descriptions do go on a bit, but that&#39;s part of the charm. It was written, says Morris, &#39;in a rush of enthusiasm like the splurge of a love affair&#39;. The enthusiasm is infectious. Venetian history, culture, religion, food - she relishes them all, from the glory years between the 12th and 15th centuries when La Serenissima controlled the trade routes between east and west, to the nuns at one of the more fashionable convents claiming their right to supply a mistress for the new papal nuncio, to the notice on the Grand Canal: &#39;It is forbidden to spit on the swimmers.&#39; Don&#39;t go to Venice without it. - Sue Arnold, The Guardian</p><h2>Scott 2017 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, Volume 1: A-B: United States, United Nations &amp; Countries of the World (A-B) (Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue: Vol.1: U.S., Countri)</h2><p>With hundreds of value changes across numerous different countries, Volume 1 of the 2017 Scott Catalog features some significant alterations.

In his first volume of autobiography, <i>Panegyric</i>, Debord recounted his interest in classical war theory as espoused by the Prussian military theorist, Carl von Clausewitz. Debord devised and wrote the board game and book <i>A Game of War</i> in collaboration with his wife, Alice Becker-Ho, who has assisted with the production of this publication. As he writes in <i>Panegyric</i>: &#x201c;I have studied the logic of war. Moreover I succeeded, a long time ago, in presenting the basics of its movements on a rather simple board game. I have played this game and, in the often difficult conduct of my life I have utilized lessons from it.&#x201d; The game became Debord&#x2019;s obsession in the years before his suicide in 1994.

The periodic table, your map for this trip, is the most important concept in chemistry. It hangs in classrooms and labs throughout the world, providing support for students, suggesting new avenues of research for professionals, succinctly organizing the whole of chemistry. The one hundred or so elements listed in the table make up everything in the universe, from microscopic organisms to distant planets. Just how does the periodic table help us make sense of the world around us? Using vivid imagery, ingenious analogies, and liberal doses of humor P. W. Atkins answers this question. He shows us that the <i>Periodic Kingdom</i> is a systematic place. Detailing the geography, history and governing institutions of this imaginary landscape, he demonstrates how physical similarities can point to deeper affinities, and how the location of an element can be used to predict its properties. Here's an opportunity to discover a rich kingdom of the imagination kingdom of which our own world is a manifestation.</p><p>The periodic table of the elements is the grand, unified theory of chemistry. In <i>The Periodic Kingdom</i>, P. W. Atkins imagines the table as a landscape, with fields of metals, pools of mercury and bromine, clouds of gases, and the offshore island of rare earths. He describes the history of this metaphoric kingdom and shows how its laws are those of physical chemistry: they are the expression in the visible world of the invisible dance of subatomic particles. <i>The Periodic Kingdom</i> is an excellent book for students at any level who want to see the connections between chemistry, physics, and "real life."P. W. Atkins is a university lecturer in physical chemistry at the University of Oxford and a fellow and tutor at Lincoln College, Oxford.</p><h2>TNTC: 2 Peter and Jude (Tyndale Commentaries Series)</h2><p>The epistle of 2 Peter has had a very rough passage down the centuries," says Michael Green in this commentary. "Its entry into the Canon was precarious in the extreme . . . It was deemed second-class Scripture by Luther, rejected by Erasmus, and regarded with hesitancy by Calvin." And about Jude he says, "We can learn a great deal about a man by listening to what he has to say about himself. Jude makes two significant claims . . . He is a servant of Jesus Christ . . . He is a brother of James" (Jesus' brother). Discover these ideas and much more by reading Green's excellent commentary.<br><br>The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries have long been a trusted resource for Bible study. Written by some of the world's most distinguished evangelical scholars, these twenty volumes offer clear, reliable, and relevant explanations of every book in the New Testament.<br><br>These Tyndale volumes are designed to help readers understand what the Bible actually says and what it means. The introduction to each volume gives a concise but thorough description of the authorship, date, and historical background of the biblical book under consideration. The commentary itself examines the text section by section, drawing out its main themes. It also comments on individual verses and deals with problems of interpretation. The aim throughout is to get at the true meaning of the Bible and to make its message plain to readers today.</p><p></p><h2>The Finality of Christ</h2><p>The Christian Church uses the language of uniqueness and finality to talk about Jesus Christ. But confronted with the witness of holy men from other traditions and the wide sweep of non-Christian history, Christians are being forced more than ever before to ask what this kind of language means. How can it be said that Jesus is a final revelation? What is it about him which gives him his distinctive place? Nowhere are these questions more pressing than in the Far East, where there are religions which go back far beyond the origins of Christianity. As Bishop in Madras, Lesslie Newbigin is compelled to think through the Christian claim in a peculiarly thorough way. Taking further the arguments which he developed in Honest Religion for Secular Man, he sets out the idea of the finality of Christ in terms which he hopes will be more meaningful for the present day.</p><p>(1909-1998) Lesslie Newbigin was born inNewcastle-on-Tyne, U.K., in 1909. He completed hisundergraduate studies in Cambridge and then served asStaffSecretary of the Student Christian Movement in Glasgow, Scotland. He studied theology at Westminster College atCambridge and was ordained by the Presbytery ofEdinburgh, Church of Scotland in 1936. That same year Newbiginmarried Helen Henderson and the two of them left for Indiawhere he was to be missionary of the Church of Scotland.</p><h2>Black, White, and Catholic: New Orleans Interracialism, 1947-1956</h2><p><p>Most histories of the Civil Rights Movement start with all the players in place--among them organized groups of African Americans, White Citizens' Councils, nervous politicians, and religious leaders struggling to find the right course. Anderson, however, takes up the historical moment right before that, when small groups of black and white Catholics in the city of New Orleans began efforts to desegregate the archdiocese, and the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) began, in fits and starts, to integrate quietly the New Orleans Province.</p><p>Anderson leads readers through the tumultuous years just after World War II when the Roman Catholic Church in the American South struggled to reconcile its commitment to social justice with the legal and social heritage of Jim Crow society. Though these early efforts at reform, by and large, failed, they did serve to galvanize Catholic supporters and opponents of the Civil Rights Movement and provided a model for more successful efforts at desegregation in the '60s.</p><p>As a Jesuit himself, Anderson has access to archives that remain off-limits to other scholars. His deep knowledge of the history of the Catholic Church also allows him to draw connections between this historical period and the present. In the resistance to desegregation, Anderson finds expression of a distinctly American form of Catholicism, in which lay people expect Church authorities to ratify their ideas and beliefs in an almost democratic fashion. The conflict he describes is as much between popular and hierarchical models of the Church as between segregation and integration. </p><br>This book has been made possible through a grant from the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, a state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities.<br></p><p>Greg and Bryant Gumble&#39;s dad plays an important role in the book, as he was the last African American rejected from Loyola&#39;s law school simply for being black.Most histories of the Civil Rights Movement start with all the players in place--among them organized groups of African Americans, White Citizens&#39; Councils, nervous politicians, and religious leaders struggling to find the right course. Anderson, using Jesuit archival material that still remains off-limits to other scholars, takes up the historical moment right before that, when small groups of black and white Catholics began efforts to desegregate the New Orleans archdiocese, and the Society of Jesus began, in fits and starts, to integrate quietly the New Orleans Province.</p><h2>God&#39;s Executioner</h2><p>Cromwell spent only nine months of his eventful life in Ireland, yet he stands accused there of war crimes, religious persecution and ethnic cleansing. The massacre of thousands of soldiers and civilians by the New Model Army at both Drogheda and Wexford in 1649 must rank among the greatest atrocities in Anglo-Irish history: a tale that makes decidedly uncomfortable reading for those keen to focus on Cromwell&#39;s undoubted military and political achievements elsewhere.In a century of unrelenting, bloody warfare and religious persecution throughout Europe, Cromwell was, in many ways, a product of his times. As commander-in-chief of the army in Ireland, however, the responsibilities for the excesses of the military must be laid firmly at his door, while the harsh nature of the post-war settlement also bears his personal imprint. Cromwell was no monster, but he did commit monstrous acts. A warrior of Christ, somewhat like the crusaders of medieval Europe, he acted as God&#39;s executioner, convinced throughout the horrors of the legitimacy of his cause, and striving to build a better world for the chosen few. He remains, therefore, a remarkably modern figure, somebody to be closely studied and understood, rather than simply revered or reviled.</p><p>Micheï¿½l ï¿½ Siochrï¿½ is a native of Dublin, lectures in history at Trinity College, Dublin and has written extensively on 17th-century Ireland.

Now, in his brilliant debut book, historian Jason Sokol explores the untold stories of ordinary people experiencing the tumultuous decades that forever altered the American landscape. So often historical accounts of the era have focused on the movement&#x2019;s most dramatic moments and figures, and paid greatest attention to the brave steps taken by blacks to effect long-awaited change. In this riveting book, Sokol goes beyond the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, the 1960 student sit-ins, and the soul-stirring speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr., and into the lives of middle- and working-class whites whose world was becoming unrecognizable to them. He takes us to New Orleans&#x2019;s Ninth Ward, where, in 1960, a painful episode of school integration brought out the fiercest prejudices in some and made accidental radicals of others; to Ollie&#x2019;s Barbecue in Birmingham and Pickrick Fried Chicken in Atlanta, and thousands of lunch counters in between, where &#x201c;some white employees greeted black customers as though they had been patrons for years; others slammed doors in their faces; still more served them hesitantly and reluctantly.&#x201d; <br><br><i>There Goes My Everything</i> traces the origins of the civil rights struggle from World War II, when some black and white American soldiers lived and fought side by side overseas (leading them to question Jim Crow at home), to the beginnings of change in the 1950s and the flared tensions of the 1960s, into the 1970s, when strongholds of white rule suddenly found themselves overtaken by rising black political power. Through it all, Sokol resists the easy categorization of whites caught in the torrent of change; rather, he gives us nuanced portraits of people resisting, embracing, and questioning the social revolution taking place around them. Drawing on recorded interviews, magazine bureau dispatches, and newspaper editorials, Sokol seamlessly weaves together historical analysis with firsthand accounts. Here are the stories of white southerners in their own words, presented without condescension or moral judgment. <br><br>An unprecedented picture of one of the historic periods in twentieth-century America.</p><p>Jason Sokol grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts, and attended Oberlin College and the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his doctorate in American history.

For these white soldiers who fought alongside blacks, the war left indelible imprints. "Before the war I had the same feeling towards the Negro as the typical Southerner. God didn't intend them to have equal rights with other races, I thought," Petty Officer Barton wrote in a letter to his hometown newspaper, the Lumberton, North Carolina, <i>Robesonian.</i> By 1945, his belief became one of the war's millions of casualties. "I am afraid that all race prejudice is gone from the boys who have fought this war," Sergeant Gilmer wrote to the <i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram.</i> "White boys who have seen Negroes die to save their 'buddies,' and to help keep America free, are not in favor of the 'Jim Crow' law." In several regiments, by war's end, whites and blacks ate, worked, lived, and fought together. The South's segregation laws seemed petty and absurd by comparison. "Forcing them to ride in the rear of busses and stand for white[s] to sit down, I realize now is narrow-minded childishness practiced by our state," Barton wrote. "I discovered that the Negro is a human being." It was a lesson some white southerners would soon learn. For many others, the humanity of blacks remained a threat of the first order, a fear too immediate to peacefully allow, a reality to indefinitely deny. "It isn't going to be wise for any man . . . to try to abuse the colored people any more," Joe Gilmer warned. "The veterans of this war have learned that freedom means more than just freedom for the white man." Many southern veterans carried this truth back to their communities. The question of the ensuing decade&#x2014;between the end of World War II in 1945 and the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955&#x2014;was whether white southerners would welcome or challenge it.<br><br>Joe Gilmer's and Lewis Barton's transformative experiences placed them in a minority. Many soldiers who fought alongside blacks felt their attitudes change, but they constituted only a small fraction of white southern servicemen. About two-thirds of all white soldiers said blacks should have the same rights after the war as they had before. Many justified their beliefs with assertions like, "We get along fine with the Negro, why change?" and, "They're satisfied with the way they are now." More than 90 percent of white southern soldiers supported separate military facilities and outfits. And white southerners who stayed at home defended segregation even more vehemently. The sight of blacks in uniform had the peculiar ability to spark violence. "It seems that a Negro in uniform has stimulated some white civilians and soldiers to protect the customary caste etiquette of the South," read a 1943 report on the American soldier. That "protection" often manifested itself in the form of racial violence. During the war, the South was the site of six civilian riots, twenty military riots and mutinies, and between forty-five and seventy-five lynchings. While some soldiers felt that interracial contact in the army promoted tolerance, "a larger group seemed to have re-inforced their pre-Army attitudes while in the service. . . . The job done, they wanted to get out, get home, and by and large resume where they had left off." That often meant supporting Jim Crow as staunchly as ever.<br><br>Gilmer and Barton both believed their profound wartime experiences were not unique; they thought many white southern soldiers had similar changes in attitudes. Although the testimonies of most whites challenge that generalization, there is some evidence to support it. "All of our servicemen have not reacted in the same way," Guy Johnson said in 1945. Johnson headed the Southern Regional Council, a progressive group&#x2014;made up of mostly white southerners&#x2014;that came to support integration. "Some of them have come out with worse attitudes toward the other race than they had when they went in. I believe, however, that the majority of our fighting men have had experiences which have taught them a new appreciation of their fellow Americans of another race." In fact, those with "a new appreciation" for blacks comprised but a small segment. Yet their experiences were significant, and augured larger changes in the years to come.<br><br>Before Frank Smith gained notoriety as the rare progressive congressman from the Mississippi Delta, he fought in the army during World War II. What Smith learned at Artillery Officers Training School in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1942 stayed with him for the rest of his life. "OCS at Fort Sill was a revolutionary experience to those of us from the South, and probably to a good many others from outside the South. Negro officer candidates were scattered among us wherever they happened to fall in the alphabetical list." Smith detected little resistance to this policy among southern soldiers. "The Southerners who expressed themselves to me said they had no objections, and some even voiced approval . . . [N]obody was bucking the tide." Southerners who would later oppose segregation, like Smith, often looked back on the war as a turning point. While Smith grew up as a member of the Mississippi Delta's small middle class, Claude Ramsay was raised in poverty across the state in Ocean Springs. Ramsay carried traditional southern beliefs about race into the war. Yet when he returned to civilian life, he began to believe that blacks should have their rights. He landed a job at International Paper Company shortly after the war, and won the presidency of the state AFL-CIO in 1959. For the rest of his life, Ramsay would consider the war a defining experience.<br><br>Georgia native Harold Fleming had similar memories of his service as a commander in the Pacific. "It did more to change my life than any other experience I've ever had," Fleming confessed. "I'm a . . . good old boy at heart." He neither sought nor expected any transformation in his racial views, but his war experiences thrust such changes upon him. Stationed in Okinawa, Fleming was placed in charge of African-American troops. "The nearest thing you could be in the army to being black was to be a company officer with black troops," he later told journalist Fred Powledge, "because you lived and operated under the same circumstances they did, and they got crapped all over." This experience did not instantly convert the "good old boy" to political radicalism, but it did open his eyes and change his life. " 'Radicalized' would be too strong a word. It wasn't that I came to love Negroes; it was that I came to despise the system that did this." Fleming completed the transition when he went to work for the SRC after graduating from Harvard. He would eventually lead the organization during the 1950s. Fleming kept few friends from his prewar days; he associated mostly with like-minded progressives and friends from the American Veterans Committee. The committee consisted of "usually young veterans, just back from the war, white and black, who thought there was or ought to be a new day on this race stuff. And I exchanged my old friends for a new set of friends and co-workers and collaborators." After the war, nothing in Harold Fleming's life remained the same. "The army experience activated me," he later recalled; it set him along an arc that reshaped his career, his friendships, and the stuff of his everyday life.<br><br>Most southern soldiers' life trajectories were unlike those of Frank Smith, Claude Ramsay, or Harold Fleming. Still, the majority of white southern soldiers who fought alongside blacks found that they "got along well together." A platoon sergeant from South Carolina remembered, "When I heard about it, I said I'd be damned if I'd wear the same shoulder patch they did. After that first day when we saw how they fought, I changed my mind. They're just like any of the other boys to us." Many soldiers confirmed that in combat the color line vanished. "We was trapped behind the line, and white was afraid of dying as blacks," African-American veteran Wilson Evans remembered of the Battle of the Bulge. "And there was no color, no nothing. . . . I did see that Americans could become Americans for about eight or nine days." While these soldiers asserted that race was inconsequential in combat, an overwhelming majority of white southern soldiers still resented the army's integrated living quarters. Combat suspended the color line, but the garrison introduced it again.<br><br>Seth Lurie, an air force major from New Orleans, was stationed after the war at Craig Field in rural Dallas County, Alabama. He described himself as "a reconstructed southerner," and attributed that conversion to his military career. "The greatest teacher is experience . . . My education on this came solely from the military." Like Frank Smith, Lurie was housed alphabetically at Officer Training School. In that interracial contact, prejudices centuries in the making dissolved during everyday interaction:<br><br>That was my first real contact with Negroes. . . . I learned that a Negro was a human being, with blood in his brain, and perspiration on his brow, with aches the same . . . ambitions the same, thought of home the same. I learned later that he died the same as a white man dies, for the same cause. Also in combat I learned that he has the same courage and daring as a white man. . . . To the best of my knowledge, there is no resentment on the part of any white officer.<br><br>Lurie's revelations were powerful. They showed that weeks of experie...</p><h2>DEEP The Story of Skiing and The Future of Snow</h2><p>DEEP is a book about skiers, written and produced by lifelong skiers, with a message that reaches far beyond the slopes we draw inspiration from. It covers a sport that has inspired millions and the mountains and snowfall that make it possible. It is not a tale of the end. It is a beginning - a reminder of how dynamic and fulfilling the skiing life is. And a wake-up call regarding what needs to be done to save it. The narrative follows the unlikely rise of skiing from prehistoric Norwegian hunters to nobility in the Alps in the 1800s to present-day freeriders on the vaunted slopes of the Rocky Mountains. On his global tour of the most celebrated peaks in the Northern Hemisphere, from Washington&#39;s Cascade Range to Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn, Fox talks to alpinists about the allure and mysticism of the sport and to scientists about climate change and its effect on snow-ultimately finding a story that is far larger than the impending demise of skiing. For the seven million skiers in America who dedicate their winters to tracking storms and waking up at dawn to catch the first chairlift, the lifestyle change will be radical. It will likely be far worse for the rest of the world. Fox uses primary evidence and interviews, mixed with groundbreaking scientific studies, to explain exactly how and when the Great Melt will play out, the vital importance snow and ice have to Earth&#39;s climate system and the tremendous groundswell that is rising up to fight climate change. DEEP goes on to map a way to mitigate global warming, reduce human impact on our planet and repair the water cycle. As it turns out, the efforts to save snow and ice might end up saving the world.</p><p>Porter Fox was born in New York and raised on the coast of Maine.

It was dark and stormy, and the 28 commandos on board Torbay had great difficulty climbing into their rubber dinghies and paddling towards the shore. Disaster struck the second submarine, Talisman, when a giant wave swept eleven commandos waiting on deck overboard. At dawn on the morning of 13 November the depleted raiding party was finally ashore, cold, wet and exhausted, but determined nonetheless to press on with their audacious mission - the assassination of General Erwin Rommel, commander of the German forces in North Africa. </p><p>The raid made headlines round the free world. It was a shining example of British pluck and daring, proclaimed the papers, and to prove the point, Keyes was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

Yet crucial lessons were learned by subsequent special forces' operations, particularly by the SAS who carried out their first mission on the same night as the raid on Rommel's HQ.

The author covers what is known about the beginnings of sporting events in Greece, including the inception of the Olympic and other regularly scheduled games. The events are described in detail, and no effort is made to gloss over the often brutal nature of some of the contests, especially boxing, where the participants were fortunate to survive without permanent damage. Also put to rest is the myth that Greek athletes competed purely for the joy of sport. Winners were granted exemption from taxation by their city-states, as well as cash prizes and other lavish gifts. Of course, what the Romans considered sport (gladiatorial games and mass hunts of wild animals in the arena) were far more bloody and brutal than anything the Greeks took part in, and unsavory details are included. Numerous black-and-white drawings and photos are a fine addition to the text. Frequent quotations from classical sources, including Homer and Virgil, and an excellent bibliography help to make this a worthwhile purchase.-David N.

It was into this watery hell that, in 1942, Vito Dumas set sail in a 31-foot ketch, outfitted with makeshift gear and provisions and a stoic indifference to the privations he would endure. His 20,000-mile voyage through the vast Southern Ocean set many records, including first solo sailor to round Cape Horn and first to sail around the world with only three landfalls.</p><p>What Are &#x201c;The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics?&#x201d; No one meets the ocean on quite such intimate terms as the sailor in a small boat. No one experiences a solitude more absolute than that encountered by long-distance single-handed sailors like Joshua Slocum or Bernard Moitessier. Since the early nineteenth century, when Byron and Shelley put to sea in their own boats in order to set themselves adrift in nature at its most turbulent and unruly, writing and sailing have gone hand in hand. <p>There have been writers who sailed&#x2014;Wilkie Collins, Joseph Conrad, Robert Louis Stevenson, Hilaire Belloc, Jack London, E.B. White, William Golding, John Barth, Thomas McGuane, Geoffrey Wolff&#x2014;along with a multitude of sailors who wrote, from Slocum and John Voss to Tristan Jones and the father-son team of Daniel and David Hays. After nearly two hundred years, the literature of small-boat voyaging under sail is enormous, and every publishing season sees more additions to the list. </p><p>It is the function of The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics to recognize and celebrate the relatively small number of truly important books in this library. Some have been chosen because the voyages they describe are themselves of unignorable merit; some because the sheer brilliance of their writing demands their inclusion. Most combine in equal parts serious nautical interest with literary excellence. </p><p>As general editor of the series, I am always trying to keep in mind the bookshelves on my own 35-foot ketch. A proper ship&#x2019;s library isn&#x2019;t restricted to books with boats in them, of course; I wouldn&#x2019;t happily set sail for more than a day or two without novels by Dickens, Trollope, Evelyn Waugh, and Saul Bellow, and poetry by Pope, Keats, Tennyson, Hardy, Philip Larkin, and Robert Lowell. The big question is which small-boat voyages can stand up in such exalted literary company? Not very many is the honest answer, and half the function of an editor is to know what he must reject. The books that won&#x2019;t figure in the series are as important as those that will. </p><p>We won&#x2019;t be publishing quaint curiosities. Period charm does not make a classic, and though I have a soft spot for, say, Nathaniel Bishop&#x2019;s Four Months in a Sneak Box (1879), and an even softer one for Maurice Griffiths&#x2019; The Magic of the Swatchways (1932), they won&#x2019;t be found in The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics. Nor will the many salty &#x201c;yarns&#x201d; full of the faded yo-ho-ho of generations past. Whimsical accounts of family vacations afloat (the obligatory adventure with the dog and the dinghy...) will be left to gather dust in peace. So will all those melancholy solo voyages in which the writers go to sea in order to discover themselves. </p><p>There remain the books whose vigor has not dimmed with the passage of time, whose voice is as alive and meaningful now as it was on their first publication&#x2014;the books that should be essential reading for every literate sailor. No. 2 in the series is Richard Maury&#x2019;s The Saga of Cimba, first published in 1939; No. 4 is The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst by Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall, first published in 1971. They are perfect examples of what I mean: one a loving close-up portrait of the sea in all its moods, written by a master mariner with an astonishing literary gift; the other a study, by two journalists, of a man who lost touch with reality during the course of the first singlehanded round-the-world yacht race. Each&#x2014;in its very different way&#x2014;is an indispensable book. Each contributes an important thread to the larger pattern in the carpet, which is the great, various, and intricate design of the literature of small-boat sailing. </p><p>The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics will surprise our readers with its richness and complexity. Since Homer&#x2019;s Odyssey, the voyage has supplied one of the classic forms in literature&#x2014;both as a grand metaphor for life itself in the long passage from birth to death, and as a sequence of tests and adventures. Equally, the boat (and especially the small boat) has long stood as a symbol of selfhood&#x2014;a fragile ark bearing the journeying soul to its destination. Hilaire Belloc put the matter beautifully in The Cruise of the Nona: </p><p> "The cruising of a boat here and there is very much what happens to the soul of a man in a larger way... We are granted great visions, we suffer intolerable tediums, we come to no end of the business, we are lonely out of sight of England, we make astonishing landfalls&#x2014;and the whole rigmarole leads us along no whither, and yet is alive with discovery, emotion, adventure, peril and repose." Those five nouns should be emblazoned above The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics: it is from the interweaving of discovery, emotion, adventure, peril, and repose that the pattern of sailing literature is made, and we shall do our best to honor each and every one in our selection of the best books ever written about life aboard small boats at sea. Jonathan Raban<br> Series Editor<br> March 2001</p><p>"One of the classic small-boat voyages of all time."--Jonathan Raban </p><p>In June 1942, Vito Dumas set off from Buenos Aires for a trip around the world unlike any previous circumnavigation--eastward over the "impossible route," the Roaring Forties of the Southern Ocean: south of the Cape of Good Hope, south of Australia, and south of Cape Horn. His craft, the <i>Lehg II</i>, a 31-foot ketch named for his mistress, carried only the most makeshift gear and provisions; he refused to carry a sea anchor, a bilge pump, or more than one screwdriver, and he had so few clothes that he had to stuff them with newspaper to keep warm. He also sailed without a radio, as carrying one during wartime would have labeled him a spy. </p><p>He was the first to complete the 20,000-mile voyage single-handed, the first solo sailor to round Cape Horn and survive, and the first to sail around the world with only three landfalls (in South Africa, New Zealand, and Chile). But what sets this story apart is Dumas's powerful prose, relating elation and depression, hardship and relaxation, and, above all, his unrelenting determination in the face of adversity. The terror of sailing through massive storms without respite from the helm alternates with periods of relative calm when he reflects on the peaceful, enchanting nature of the sea. His trio of landfalls--sojourns he called "calm waters where my spirit could rest"--add yet another dimension to this beautiful tale. <i>Alone through the Roaring Forties</i> is also a tribute to <i>Lehg II</i>, Dumas's beloved boat. He calls her his "shipmate," and "faithful companion," "an ideal floating house of extraordinary strength and endurance," and had complete faith in her abilities and performance. </p><p>First published in 1960, <i>Alone through the Roaring Forties</i> is a classic tale of skilled navigation, seamanship, and great adventure, but it also demonstrates, as Dumas intended, the possibilities of global peace and friendship in a world at war. As Jonathan Raban writes in his introduction, "Dumas chose to see his circumnavigation as a test of his ordinary humanity. There are hurricane-force winds here, and hazardous waves, but . . . it is his reverence for the small things that gives <i>Alone through the Roaring Forties</i> its distinction as a classic." </p><p>"Other solo circumnavigators have made the world seem dauntingly larger by their harrowing exploits; Dumas makes it seem smaller. He rides lightly over the vicissitudes of his voyage, perhaps because his mission was to connect up the world at a time when it was tragically divided."--from the introduction by Jonathan Raban </p><p><i>The Sailor's Classics</i> recognizes and celebrates the best books ever written about life aboard small boats at sea: <i>40,000 Miles in a Canoe</i>, John C.

It is both the ultimate reference book and an inspirational guide, providing expert guidance on all aspects of drawing animals - including size, proportion, perspective, anatomy, skeletal structure and musculature. The book goes into great detail, and provides numerous diagrams as well as drawings in a range of styles and rendered in a variety of different drawing media including pencil, charcoal, pastels and inks. A huge range of animals is included, from dogs, horses and cats to tigers, elephants, camels and apes, so whatever animal you are interested in, this book will enable you to capture its essence down to the last hoof or paw.</p><p>Gottfried Bammes, born in 1920 in Freital, Germany, worked as an art teacher at the College of Fine Arts in Dresden. Bammes was a prolific writer and artist, was considered to be a master of life drawing and anatomy,and produced numerous books on the subject in his lifetime. In 1974 he was awarded the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic for Science and Technology and received the Culture and Art Prize of the City of Freital in 2000. He died in 2007.May 13 This is an incredible guide to drawing animals. Based on the theory that if you understand the structure, you can draw the form, this book provides detailed diagrams and instruction to help you draw animals accurately. The book looks at skeletal structure, torso shape, proportion, perspective and more. The selection of animals both domestic and wild is varied. Animals are shown in different, natural, life-like poses. The book shows how to capture natural animal poses and movement. A variety of media has been used to capture these wonderful drawings. This book provides a thorough grounding suitable for any artists no matter what their skill. I love the tigers, dogs and orang utang best. This is recommended for anyone trying to draw animals. * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts * May 13 This very thorough guide progresses through detailed lessons covering structure, anatomy and articulation long before any completed work is encountered. Although the publisher pitches it as suitable for the beginner, it is more suited to the serious student who is prepared to put in the hours of study it requires. It is also worth noting that the animals covered tend to be larger and almost exclusively wild, from big cats and horses to elephants. If you are serious about drawing animals, this will reward you fully, but the less serious student might find it a bit overwhelming. * Artist, The * Mar 13 This is a weighty and impressive tome that is, I think, more likely to appeal to the serious, maybe even semi-professional artist than to the beginner. To be fair to it, it makes no claim to be an introduction. The first thing that strikes you, looking through it, is how few actual complete drawings there are and that, for the most part. those you get are very loose and quite sketchy. Again, this isn&#39;t a book that aims to impress by wizardry. Rather, it&#39;s a comprehensive and progressive guide that proceeds by looking at structure and anatomy - differences between, say, herbivores and carnivores come as sub-headings in chapters such as The Hindquarters. Based on a German original, the book has quite a literal approach, but is invaluable if you want to get the details of your work absolutely correct and it&#39;s something to be worked through rather than dipped into. Used in this way, it could keep you occupied for anything up to a year and leave you very proficient indeed at the end. Whether you think it&#39;s for you very much depends on whether you want such an exhaustive (and potentially exhausting) approach. It&#39;s pretty much one of a kind and certainly not for the faint-hearted. If you&#39;re of sterner stuff, though, I think you could love it. * Artbookreview.net * Sept 13 If you have seen Mr Bammes&#39; earlier work The Complete Guide to Life Drawing (also reviewed on this site) then you will be familiar with his style. If not, prepare for an impressively exhaustive course in drawing. Most art books teach you how to draw the outside of something, but here you are also instructed about what is inside the subjects you are drawing. Getting the structure right is after all more likely to result in a lifelike representation, and this book goes into anatomy in some depth. There are pictures of skeletons and proportions all marked out, which is very helpful. Each chapter also contains plenty of things to try out for yourself, including observation of your would-be subjects. To its detriment, at times there is rather too much information about anatomy. Reading through pages of this type of thing if you are interested in drawing rather than training to be a vet can be more than a little daunting, as well as difficult to understand. Skipping through and concentrating on the drawing alone is not quite enough to truly grasp it all, so I would recommend this book to those who are truly determined to master the art of drawing animals rather than the dabbler. Some prior knowledge of (or at least interest in) anatomy would be a help too but if this is you then after having worked through this book you should be pretty au fait with the art of wildlife drawing. * Myshelf.com * Aug 13 If you have room for only book on how to draw animals on your bookshelf - this has to be it. This is an absolutely stunning, detailed guide ideal for both beginners and experts alike. There are complex studies of skulls, bodies and musculature showing how they exist and how they should be drawn. Help is given on achieving the right proportions, perspective as well as plotting the rise and fall of the body surface. The instructions cover a range of popular animals including cats (both large and small), horses, dogs, gorillas and cows. Both domestic and wild animals are used as examples and are portrayed in a variety of poses and in different types of media. Although this is not a step by step guide, any artist working through this book will provide all the techniques and knowledge necessary to be able to draw an lifelike animal. All the explanations are extremely informative - detail is the keynote of this book. 5 stars. * Monstersandcritics.com * July 13 Bammes takes a holistic, methodical approach in this thorough and in-depth title. Readers will learn about the anatomy, balance, and movement of various animals, as well as how these aspects differ from the more familiar human figure. One particularly helpful section is devoted to explaining the proportions of a range of animals, using gridded diagrams. The exercises included take the form of suggestions and tips that are open to the readers&#39; interpretation and experimentation. VERDICT Best suited to serious intermediate and advanced artists. * Library Journal, USA * Summer 13 Gottfried Bammes was professor of art at the Dresden Acacemy of Fine Arts in Germany and is renowned for his anatomic drawing textbooks. Originally published in 2009, this new Complete Guide to Drawing Animals has been translated from the original German. The book is divided into seven sections, starting with Gauging Proportion in which the author shows how to establish the main proportions of your subject using the ratios between the height and length of an animal&#39;s body. Set exercises in plotting basic proportions will help you to gain a better understanding. The next section deals with body structure, looking at animals&#39; skeletons to help create accurate drawings. Once again, the author sets a range of exercises to work through to gain experience, looking at animals at rest and when moving. Large sections are devoted to individual aspects of animal shapes: the hindquarters, foreleg and front foot, torso shapes, the skull and head and finally, the complete animal form, including how to capture the markings and textures of animal fur and hide. There&#39;s quite a lot of information to take in here, but the author doesn&#39;t over complicate the information, and the final illustrations are relaxed and instinctive, belying the precision and knowledge the drawings are based on. * Leisure Painter, The *</p><h2>Seasons of the Spirit: Daily Meditations for Adults in Mid-Life (Hazelden Meditations)</h2><p><b>The daily readings in <i>Seasons of the Spirit</i> teach&nbsp;those of us age 40 and beyond to let go of the past, embrace the present, and look forward to the future.</b><br><br>Our mid-life years.

Derived from a romantic and ancient folklore, the hidden meanings of flowers were largely forgotten until the Victorians revived the tradition, turning flower-giving into an art. <i>The Complete Language of Flowers</i> explains the meanings of both wild and cultivated flowers, interweaving classic prose and verse with botanical notes. From violets, snowdrops, and apple blossoms to dandelions and thistles, it traces the folklore and mythology of each flower, explaining its traditional and romantic meanings. Throughout, the text is enhanced with gorgeous botanical illustrations of each plant, and by Victorian paintings, which complement the verse.

Part One explains step-by-step techniques for origami, pop-ups, paper sculpture, papier-mï¿½chï¿½, papermaking, decoupage, model making, quilling, and weaving. Part Two is a gallery of spectacular artwork by a multitude of paper artists employing various techniques, from complicated origami animals to elaborate woven shapes to intricate cut-paper &#34;paintings&#34; to room-size paper architecture bordering on sculptural furniture. A beginner should achieve some degree of success with the majority of the techniques, though many appear to require practice before the elaborate level of artistry evident in the beautiful color photos can be reached. Still, just browsing through the artists&#39; gallery should prove inspirational.Titling this book an encyclopedia is somewhat misleading, since it is not a reference book in dictionary format. It is instead a survey guide in two parts: techniques, consisting of the basic procedures of origami, paper sculpture, papier-mache, papermaking, and quilling; and themes, consisting of an exhibit of works by artists in paper. The techniques section is well illustrated with line drawings and photographs and includes a few step-by-step projects. The theme section has color photographs of finished works with descriptive annotations. This is a much more colorful book than most papercraft books and is an excellent source of ideas.

Featuring a wide range of scholars specializing in American history and ethnic studies, this powerful collection of essays highlights historical moments and movements on the Pacific Coast and across the Pacific to reveal a different story of race and politics. From labor and anticolonial activists around World War I and multiracial campaigns by anarchists and communists in the 1930s to the policing of race and sexuality after World War II and transpacific movements against the Vietnam War, <i>The Rising Tide of Color</i> brings to light histories of race, state violence, and radical movements that continue to shape our world in the twenty-first century.</p><p><p><i>The Rising Tide of Color</i> brings to light histories of race, state violence, and radical movements that continue to shape our world in the twenty-first century.</p><b>Moon-Ho Jung </b>is the Walker Family Endowed Professor and associate professor of history at the University of Washington and the author of <i>Coolies and Cane.</i></p><h2>Skagboys</h2><p>Both a prequel to the world-renowned <b>Trainspotting</b>, and an alternative version of it, <b>Skagboys</b><i> </i>is Irvine Welsh's greatest work.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mark Renton seems to have it all: he's the first in his family to go to university, he's young, has a pretty girlfriend and a great social life. But Thatcher's government is destroying working-class communities across Britain, and the post-war certainties of full employment, educational opportunity and a welfare state are gone.

He was kind, generous, and very slow to anger. This is a story about love, perseverance, and how love conquers all. Becky Perry Brown was married for fifty-four years to country music legend, Jim Ed Brown, member of The Grand Ole Opry for over fifty years, and a member of The Country Music Hall of Fame. While he followed his dream, her dream was to be a professional dancer. She was a model, taught self-improvement and dance classes. Eventually, she followed a dream and opened her own dance studio. For forty-six years, young people came and went through those doors, learning ballet, tap, and interpretive dance. They became a part of the story and Jim Ed and Becky were a part of theirs. By writing this book, Becky has shared some of the good times, some of the bad times, some funny stories, some lessons learned, and set straight some rumors. She had her doubts at times, but God has never failed her. His grace is sufficient always.

Stressing that animation is a subtle and exacting art form which breathes life into inanimate drawings, Tony White, an award-winning animator, covers every aspect of the process. He provides technical information and explains in easy-to-follow text and step-by-step illustrations, how to capture movement, expression, and emotion. He shows you how to convncingly animate birds and animals and explores special effects - wind, water, fire, and solid objects - that can add realism, drama, and atmosphere to animation.<br><br>This book takes the mystery out of the animation process and provides sound, reliable guidance and information.

White lives in London with his wife and two daughters.Like so many of the crafts, animation has suffered from the introduction of new technology. In this case computer-generated images have done much to displace the art of animation. It is White's intention to provide a foundation for apprenticeship training in order to preserve the animator's craft. His book is primarily a multilevel workbook. The only assumption is that the reader will be a cartoonist with an interest in animation. White lets the reader in on all pertinent aspects of animation from inbetweening to matching dialogue with the drawn pictures. At the end of each chapter there is an assignment for the practitioner. A valuable reference tool for most libraries and essential for art libraries.

Her argument is based on two notions: first, that American manners are bad, and second, that because the United States is a nation of immigrants who share "the desire to be treated fairly, the imagination to sketch a new life, and the determination to pursue it," Americans are uniquely positioned to improve their manners and create an etiquette system that could serve as a model for the international community. Martin acknowledges that not all citizens will acquiesce to this new and improved etiquette, but she has a suggestion for how to handle that; we must discourage bullying and bashing through the simple exercise of social disapproval and exclusion. In support of her thesis, Martin provides a history of American manners, from the founding fathers, who first envisioned an "etiquette of equality," through the present day, when "equality" is often misused and greed and selfishness reign. But the original principle of equality stands, says Martin, an astute observer of social customs and manners who cares deeply about the instability of tradition and rituals, a shift in emphasis from the family to the individual and the tendency to value frankness above tact. But she heaps one observation on top of another without ever quite pulling together the pieces, and the details of how this new etiquette is to be developed are painfully glossed over for an issue so central to our national (and international) well-being. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Groom with a View (Jane Jeffry Mysteries, No. 11)</h2><p>Caterers Jane and Shelley are pleased as punch to host a lavish wedding in the old monastery, but when a sudden thunderstorm knocks out the electricity, murder breaks the guests&#39; nuptial spell, and Jane steps in to investigate</p><p><p></p><p>Jill Churchill is the author of twelve Jane Jeffry mysteries and two Grace and Favor novels. She lives in the Midwest -- on purpose.</p>In her 11th Jane Jeffry mystery (after The Merchant of Menace, 1998), Agatha Award-winner Churchill delivers another charming, if somewhat predictable, cozy. Looking to earn some extra money because her car is always having problems, widowed mom Jane takes on a job as wedding consultant to Livvy Thatcher, a young businesswoman. Jane then enlists her best friend and neighbor, Shelley Nowack, to help her. The wedding is to be held at an old family hunting lodge that was once a monastery, and it proves to be a somewhat spooky venue for the nuptials. After Jane and Shelley arrive at the lodge, the eccentric cast of characters (and eventual murder suspects) begins to gather: a mysterious, laconic caretaker whom Livvy calls "Uncle Joe"; Mrs. Crossthwait, a cranky, elderly seamstress; three bridesmaids; a caterer; and a florist named Larkspur, not to mention Livvy's elderly aunts. Add the bride and her father, an arrogant captain of industry, and the groom, his mother and brother, and the stage is well set for shenanigans. Larkspur tells Jane the story of a hidden family treasure, and later it is Larkspur who discovers Mrs. Crossthwait dead at the foot of the stairs. Did she fall, or was she pushed? To find out, Jane enlists the aid of her lover, Chicago cop Mel Van Dyne, who comes along to help the local police. Another murder puts a definite damper on the postwedding festivities, and soon after Jane and Shelley winkle out the solution. Though the identity of the killer will come as no great surprise, Churchill delivers a satisfying plot laced with subtle humor and some enjoyable gothic flourishes.

Although the Wizard Howl (this time in the guise of an irritating, lisping little boy); his feisty wife, Sophie; and Calcifer the fire demon play important roles, the story centers on Charmain, a bookish teen. When Charmain&#x2019;s great-uncle William, the king&#x2019;s Royal Wizard, falls deathly ill and is taken in by elves for a cure, Charmain is sent to look after William&#x2019;s house, which is, indeed, a house of many ways and rooms and magic within. She begins reading William&#x2019;s books and discovers that she has inherited some of his gifts. Enriching this elaborate and satisfying comic fantasy are some delicious characters, including a&nbsp;little dog named Waif, who seems to be guarding Charmain; young Peter, who arrives to become the wizard&#x2019;s apprentice; the elderly king and his mysteriously vanishing treasury; the evil heir-apparent; and a fearsome creature called a&nbsp;lubbock. Long-standing devotees of this richly textured world, as well as new fans (who may have first encountered&nbsp;it through the 2005 animated film of Howl&#x2019;s Moving Castle), will find that their third visit&nbsp;fulfills every expectation.

Millions die as planes fall from the sky, people tumble down staircases, and cars plow into each other.</p><p>But that's the least of the survivors' challenges. During the blackout, everyone experienced a glimpse of what his or her future holds&#x2015;and the interlocking mosaic of these visions threatens to unravel the present.</p></p><p>What would you do if you got a glimpse of your own personal future and it looked bleak? Try to change things, or accept that the future is unchangeable and make the best of it? In <i>Flashforward</i>, Nobel-hungry physicists conducting an unimaginably high-energy experiment accidentally induce a global consciousness shift. In an instant, everyone on Earth is "flashed forward" 21 years, experiencing several minutes of the future. But while everyone is, literally, out of their minds, their bodies drop unconscious; when the world reawakens, car wrecks, botched surgeries, falls, and other mishaps add up to massive death and destruction.<p> Slowly, as recovery efforts continue, people realize that during the Flashforward (as it comes to be called) they experienced a vision of the future. The range of visions is astounding--those who would be asleep in the future saw psychedelic dream landscapes, while others saw nothing at all (presumably they'd be dead). But those who saw everyday life 20 years hence have to come to grips with evidence of dreams forsaken (or realized). Soon, the physicists who caused the Flashforward are struggling to help the world decide whether the future is changeable--and whether the experiment is worth repeating. Robert J. Sawyer has captured a truly compelling idea with <i>Flashforward</i>, and he fully explores what such an event might mean to humanity. Fans will find this to be his best work to date, although the ending seems rushed after a detailed buildup. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>"[Robert J. Sawyer is ] fast becoming one of the most important names in science fiction." --<i>Rocky Mountain News</i></p><h2>True History of the Kelly Gang</h2><p>True History of the Kelly Gang</p><p>"What is it about we Australians, eh?" demands a schoolteacher near the end of Peter Carey's <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i>. "Do we not have a Jefferson? A Disraeli? Might not we find someone better to admire than a horse-thief and a murderer?" It's the author's sole nod to the contradictory feelings Ned Kelly continues to evoke today, more than a century after his death. A psychopathic killer to some, a crusading folk hero to others, Kelly was a sharpshooting outlaw who eluded a brutal police manhunt for nearly two years. For better or worse, he's now a part of the Australian national myth. Indeed, the opening ceremonies for the Sydney Olympics featured an army of Ned Kellys dancing about to Irish music, which puts him in the symbolic company of both kangaroos and Olivia Newton-John.<p> What's to be gained from telling this illiterate bushranger's story yet again? Quite a lot, as it turns out. For starters, there is the remarkable vernacular poetry of Carey's narrative voice. Fierce, funny, ungrammatical, steeped in Irish legends and the frontier's moral code, this voice is the novel's great achievement--and perhaps the greatest in Carey's distinguished career. It paints a vivid picture of an Australia where English landowners skim off the country's best territory while government land grants allow the settlers just enough acreage to starve. Cheated, lied to, and persecuted by the authorities at every opportunity, young Kelly retains no faith in his colonial masters. What he does trust, oddly, is the power of words: </p><blockquote> And here is the thing about them men they was Australians they knew full well the terror of the unyielding law the historic memory of UNFAIRNESS were in their blood and a man might be a bank clerk or an overseer he might never have been lagged for nothing but still he knew in his heart what it were to be forced to wear the white hood in prison he knew what it were to be lashed for looking a warder in the eye ... so the knowledge of unfairness were deep in his bone and in his marrow. </blockquote> Ned Kelly as literary hero? Strangely enough, that's what he becomes, at least in Carey's rendering. Pouring his heart out in a series of letters to the country at large, Kelly wants nothing more than to be <i>heard</i>--and for the dirt-poor son of an Irish convict, that's an audacious ambition indeed. It's not so surprising, then, that his story continues to speak to Australians. Like all colonial countries, Australia was built at a steep human price, and the memory of all those silenced voices lives on. <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i> takes its epigraph from Faulkner: "The past is not dead. It is not even past." And like Faulkner's own vast chronicle of dispossession, it's haunted by tragedies as large as history itself. <i>--Mary Park</i>"Carey's True History of the Kelly Gang purports to transcribe documents, 'thirteen parcels of stained and dog-eared papers,' in which the celebrated outlaw, on the run, set down for the benefit of his daughter (whom he was destined never to see) a heartfelt account and justification of his short and violent life. The ingenuity, empathy, and poetic ear that the novelist brings to his feat of imposture cannot be rated too high; hardly a colloquialism feels turned wrong, hardly a homely phrase feels rote, patronizing, or quaint . . . The poetry that Carey can coax from this lightly educated ruffian's lightly punctuated prose gratifies us on every page [and] rises to the occasion like the Song of Songs." &#x2014;John Updike, The New Yorker <br><br> "This avalanche of a novel [raises] a national legend to the level of an international myth." <br> &#x2014;Ron Charles, The Christian Science Monitor <br><br> "A spectacular feat of literary ventriloquism [with] all the makings of a swaggering adventure tale as well as a classic Western tragedy. The effect is triumphantly eclectic, as if Huck Finn and Shakespeare had joined forces to prettify the legend of Jesse James . . . But this rip-snorting Western novel rises far above such considerations and works on its own great merits as a seamlessly imagined coming-of-age story set in wild country and wilder times. Though Ned Kelly died in 1880 just before his 26th birthday, he could not be more furiously alive." &#x2014;Janet Maslin, The New York Times <br><br> "The best measure of the novel's excellence [is] that you never doubt it's Kelly's own words you're reading in the headlong, action-packed story filled with stage-coach holdups, bank robberies and backstabbing treachery." <br> &#x2014;Malcolm Jones, Newsweek <br><br> "Ambitious and adventurous . . . from lyrical to rowdy and ribald . . . Peter Carey's Ned Kelly is somebody worth knowing and remembering, and his novel is also worth our best attention." &#x2014;George Garrett, The Washington Post Book World <br><br> "Highly original . . . To read it is to be carried away." &#x2014;Sara Dowse, The Minneapolis Star-Tribune <br><br> "True History of the Kelly Gang is a true wonder. It's lyrical and hard-edged at the same time, constantly inventive, pell-mell in its storytelling, and best of all, the voice Peter Carey invents for Ned Kelly is nothing less than mint-fresh original. This is just amazing writing." &#x2014;Kent Haruf <br><br> "A big, meaty novel, blending equal parts Dickens and Cormac McCarthy, and a complete success . . . Most immediately striking is how much it resembles an American Western about such legendary outlaws as Jesse James and Bonnie and Clyde." &#x2014;Ken Foster, The San Francisco Chronicle <br><br> "To succeed as literature a book must entertain. This novel is no exception&#x2014;a tough, sweet, rousing thing of ungrammatical sentences and unquestionable wisdom." &#x2014;Erik Torkells, Fortune <br><br> "There is certainly justice in putting True History on the bookshelf next to Shane . . . It rocks and cajoles the reader into a certainty that Ned Kelly is fit company not only for Jack Palance and Clint Eastwood but for Thomas Jefferson." &#x2014;Johnathan Levi, The Los Angeles Times <br><br> "The power and charm of True History [brings] Australia's legendary Ned Kelly vibrantly to life." &#x2014;Paul Gray, Time <br><br> "I completely admire Peter Carey's work&#x2014;the worlds he enters, the stakes he goes for&#x2014;and Ned Kelly's a leap even beyond the others, brilliantly constructed, gorgeously written, a simply heartbreaking story." &#x2014;Beverly Lowry <br><br> "Dazzling . . . narrated with great flair in prose heavy on expletives and light on punctuation&#x2014;yet full of music and poetry." &#x2014;The Economist <br><br> "Bolder and more challenging than anything [one of fiction's great treasure hunters] has attempted before . . . the book's power as a narrative is nearly overwhelming. The twang of Ned's untutored but vibrant prose would be hypnotic in itself, yet Carey adapts it to a series of set pieces . . . that are as gripping as any you could wish to read. He has transformed sepia legend into brilliant, even violent, color, and turned a distant myth into warm flesh and blood. Packed with incident, alive with comedy and pathos, True History of the Kelly Gang contains pretty much everything you could ask of a novel. It is an adjectival wonder. " &#x2014;Anthony Quinn, New York Times Book Review <br><br> "Wholly convincing not only as an outback adventure but also as a psychological and historical drama. It is, above all, a spectacular feat of imagination grounded in an Australian landscape [that] is an astonishing, apparently limitless place with mysteries of its own to reveal . . . Carey has immersed us so completely in Kelly's world and swept us along at such a cracking pace that the novel's last scene is physically draining, bewildering. Like Ned we can hardly believe it is all over." &#x2014;Anna Mundow, The Boston Sunday Globe <br><br>&#x201c;True History of the Kelly Gang is a true wonder. It&#x2019;s lyrical and hard-edged at the same time, constantly inventive, pell-mell in its storytelling, and, best of all, the voice Peter Carey invents for Ned Kelly is nothing less than mint-fresh original. This is just amazing writing.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kent Haruf<br><br>&#x201c;As genuine as a diamond in the rough . . . In essence an adventure saga, with numerous descriptions of the wild and forbidding Australian landscape, shocking surprises, coldhearted villains who hail from the top and the bottom of the social ladder, and a tender love story. Carey (Booker Prize winner for Oscar and Lucinda) deserves to be lionized in his native land for this triumphant historical recreation, and he will undoubtedly win a worldwide readership for a novel that teems with energy, suspense, and the true story of a memorable protagonist . . . No reader will be left unmoved.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;I completely admire Peter Carey&#x2019;s work&#x2014;the worlds he enters, the stakes he goes for&#x2014;and Ned Kelly&#x2019;s a leap even beyond the others: brilliantly constructed, gorgeously written, a simply heartbreaking story.&#x201d; &#x2014;Beverly Lowry<br></p><h2>Jacob&#39;s Journey: Wisdom to Find the Way, Strength to Carry on</h2><p>"Heartwarming...A message of deliverance and fulfillment...A cause for joy and celebration."<br>Father Malcolm Boyd<br>As readers of Noah benShea's beloved international bestseller JACOB THE BAKER already know, Jacob's humble life changed when his neighbors discovered his great wisdom, for everyone wanted to draw upon it to solve their problems.

He determines that he must go on a journey in order to rediscover life's simple pleasures. Although some readers will quickly lose patience with this simple story, most will be charmed.

From the day we were born, she made sure that we owned the exact same things, whether it was clothes, shoes, toys, or books&#x2014;we even had the same color toothbrushes. Everything had to be bought in twos. Even our names had to have an equal number of letters, and that went for our middle names, too, which were exactly the same: Blossom. I was Kaylee Blossom Fitzgerald, and my sister was Haylee Blossom Fitzgerald. That was something Mother had insisted on. Daddy told us he hadn&#x2019;t thought it was very significant at the time, so he&#x2019;d put up little argument. I&#x2019;m sure he regretted it later, as he came to regret so much he had failed to do.<br> <br>Although neither of us had the courage to complain about our names, we both wished they were different. By the time we were sixteen, Haylee had gone so far as to tell people she had no middle name. When anyone looked to me for confirmation, I agreed. That was one of those little ways Haylee gradually got me to oppose things Mother had done. I was the reluctantly rebellious twin practically dragged by my hair into the fiery ring of defiance.<br> <br>Actually, when I think about it, we were lucky to have two different first names. We couldn&#x2019;t be Haylee One and Haylee Two or Kaylee One and Kaylee Two based on who was born first, either. Mother would never tell us who was first, and Daddy hadn&#x2019;t been in the delivery room. He&#x2019;d been on a business trip. I don&#x2019;t know if he ever asked her which one of us was born first, but I doubt she would have told him anyway. She&#x2019;d pretend not to know, or maybe she really believed we were born together, hugging and clinging to each other with our tiny pink hands and arms as we were cast out of her womb and into the world, both of us harmonizing in a cry of fear. Whenever Mother described our birth, she always said that the doctor practically had to pry us apart.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought there was only one of you at first. That&#x2019;s how in sync your cries were. One voice,&#x201d; she would say, and she&#x2019;d look starry-eyed, with that soft smile of wonder that fascinated both Haylee and me when we would sit on the floor in front of her and listen to the story of ourselves. As we grew older, she wove the magical fabric in which we would be dressed, wove it into a fantasy about the perfect twins. There was one rule that if broken would bring about disaster: we had to be loved equally, or some dragon monster would destroy our enchantment.<br> <br>Daddy wasn&#x2019;t anywhere nearly as obsessed about treating us equally in every way. There was never a doubt in my mind that it was something he believed Mother would grow out of as we grew older. He humored her with his smiles and nods and especially with his favorite response to what she would demand: &#x201c;Whatever you say, Keri.&#x201d;<br> <br>He admitted that he was excited about having twins, but at first, he didn&#x2019;t see any additional burdens that other parents of more than one child had. Even as very small children, we could see that he was nowhere as uptight about it, which only infuriated Mother more. During our early years, if he forgot and bought something for me and not for Haylee, or vice versa, our mother would become so upset that, in a violent rage during which I would swear I felt a whirlwind around us, she would tear up or throw out whatever he had bought. Haylee felt the whirlwind, too, and, watching Mother, we would cling to each other as tightly as we supposedly had the day we were born.<br> <br>There was simply no excuse Daddy could use for what he had done that would satisfy her. For example, he couldn&#x2019;t say one of us liked a certain color more or was more interested in something and he had just happened to come upon it during his travels, like someone else&#x2019;s father. Oh, no. Mother would look as if she had accidentally put her finger in an electric socket and would tell him he was wrong and had done a terrible thing.<br> <br>In his defense, he pleaded, &#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, Keri, this isn&#x2019;t a capital offense.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not a capital offense?&#x201d; she fired back, her voice shrill. &#x201c;How can you not see them for what they are?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re little girls,&#x201d; he declared.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no, no, these are not just two little girls. These are perfect twins. They see the world through the same eyes, hear it through the same ears, and smell it through the same nose.&#x201d;<br> <br>He shook his head, smiling but concerned. I looked at Haylee. Was Mother right? To anyone watching us, it did look as if we liked the same foods, the same flavor of ice cream, the same candy. It was true that when we were very young, anything one of us liked, the other did, too, and anything one of us hated, the other hated. Maybe we felt we were supposed to or we would lose our mystical powers. Nevertheless, Mother was shocked Daddy didn&#x2019;t realize that.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re exaggerating,&#x201d; Daddy told her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Exaggerating? Are you in the same house, Mason? Do you see your own children?&#x201d; she asked him in what, even as a young girl, I thought was a terribly condescending tone. She sounded more like she did when she chastised us.<br> <br>Mother also had a habit of smacking her right fist against her right thigh when she started her responses to things that upset her this much. Sometimes, she did it so hard that both Haylee and I would flinch as if we felt the blows. After one of her more dramatic outbursts, I saw her thigh when she was getting ready to take a shower. It had a bright red circle where she had pounded it. Later it turned black-and-blue, and when Daddy mentioned it, she said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your fault, Mason. You might as well have struck me there yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Finally, Daddy always managed to stammer an excuse, but he still couldn&#x2019;t ever get away with &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll buy the other one something tomorrow.&#x201d; Whatever it was that he had bought one of us and not the other, it was gone that day, no matter what he had promised. Sometimes he would take it back and have his secretary return it to the store, but most times, after Mother had destroyed it or thrown it out, he would go back when he could and buy two this time, so he could give both of us whatever it was he thought one of us had wanted. He never looked happy about it. That satisfied Mother, though, and brought what Daddy called &#x201c;a fragile armistice where we tiptoed on a floor of eggshells.&#x201d; We were all smiles again. Our pounding hearts relaxed and the electric sizzle in the air disappeared, for a while anyway.<br> <br>In our house, stings, burns, and aches ran around just behind the walls and just under the floors like termites. Haylee and I were in the center of continuous little tornadoes. Sometimes I thought Haylee did things deliberately so she could see these storms brew between Daddy and Mother. It was one of the differences I sensed early between us. Haylee had an impish delight in causing little explosions between our parents.<br> <br>But she was far from the main cause of it all in the beginning. It wasn&#x2019;t difficult to understand why this turmoil was happening around Haylee and me. In our mother&#x2019;s mind, a minute after we were born, all thoughts about one of us had to be about the two of us simultaneously. She claimed it was practically blasphemous to do otherwise, because the biggest danger for any parent of identical twins was that somehow, some way, he or she would favor one over the other and destroy the confidence of the one not favored.<br> <br>It was one thing to praise one of your children because he or she had done something spectacular. Everyone knew stories about fathers who favored one son over another because he was a hero on the football field or got good grades. The same was true for a daughter who might please her mother more by being more responsible, being talented in music or art, or maybe just being prettier.<br> <br>But none of this could apply to identical twins, not in our mother&#x2019;s way of thinking.<br> <br>According to Mother, Haylee had no talents that I didn&#x2019;t have, and I had none that she didn&#x2019;t have. Certainly, neither of us could be prettier than the other. Our voices were so similar that people never knew which one had answered the phone. Even Daddy was confused sometimes when he called. There was always a question mark in the air first. &#x201c;Haylee? Kaylee?&#x201d;<br> <br>When we were a little older, Haylee often pretended to be me on the phone. I think she worried that Daddy liked me more and wanted to see how he would speak if he thought I was the one answering the phone. I suspected he did like me more than he liked her, and she knew it. Once she said, &#x201c;If he doesn&#x2019;t know which one of us it is, he&#x2019;ll say your name because he hopes it&#x2019;s you.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know if she was right. I didn&#x2019;t keep as close a count as she&nbsp;did.<br> <br>Maybe it was simply because he wasn&#x2019;t around us as much as he should have been, but if I suddenly came upon him while he was reading or if Haylee did, Daddy would look at whoever it was, and his eyes would blink for a moment as his mind settled on which one of us was there. Anyone could see that he was struggling with it because Mother had him terrified about calling me Haylee or calling her Kaylee. Mother insisted that he must know which of us was which.<br> <br>After all, how could our own father not know us? He agreed, and when he did get it wrong, he blamed himself for not concentrating or paying attention enough. However, he admitted that there were times when he was actually mistaken even though he was concentrating.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re so alike!&#x201d; he cried, hoping to be excused when Mother blew up at him for it, but all that did was prove her point and make her even more obsessive about how we were supposed to be treated.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course they&#x2019;re so alike. That&#x2019;s always been my point. You have to try even harder, Mason, and be more careful about it,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;You never liked it when your father called you by your brother&#x2019;s name, and you weren&#x2019;t even twins. He is two years older than you are, but how did you feel, Mason? Go on, confess. You felt he was thinking more of him than he was of you, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Daddy had admitted that to her once, so what could he do but retreat with the look of a punished puppy? I always felt sorrier for him than I did for us. Sometimes I pretended I was Haylee if he called me that, just so he would get away with it, but if Mother was there, that was impossible. She never made a mistake. I never knew why not, except to think that it was true that mothers knew their children better.<br> <br>There were so many rules of behavior toward us that Mother laid down, with the power and importance of the U.S. Constitution, our own Ten Commandments:<br> <br>Thou shalt not call Haylee &#x201c;Kaylee,&#x201d; or vice versa.<br> <br>Thou shalt not buy one a gift you do not buy the other.<br> <br>Thou shalt not take one somewhere and not the other.<br> <br>Thou shalt not kiss one without kissing the other.<br> <br>Thou shalt not hug or hold the hand of one without hugging or holding the hand of the other.<br> <br>Thou shalt not say good morning or good night to one without saying it to the other.<br> <br>Thou shalt not ask one a question you do not ask the other.<br> <br>Thou shalt not introduce one to someone without introducing the other.<br> <br>Thou shalt not tell one a story without telling it to the other.<br> <br>Thou shalt not smile at one without smiling at the other.<br> <br>Because of all the rules, I often thought our house was more of a laboratory than a home. I think Daddy did, too. Even Haylee admitted to feeling as if we were under observation in a glass bubble while strange new experiments on bringing up identical twins were being conducted. Many of Mother and Daddy&#x2019;s friends often also seemed to believe that. I once heard someone whisper that maybe Mother was giving reports to a special government agency. I know that, like me, Haylee felt this all made us seem strange to anyone who witnessed our upbringing. There were other twins in our community, even on our street, but they were not identical, and they seemed no different from kids who had no twins. They were permitted to wear different clothes and do different things, and their mothers weren&#x2019;t so uptight about potentially devastating personality complexes.<br> <br>But our mother would point or nod at them and say, &#x201c;Look how competitive their parents have made them. They enjoy making each other feel bad. You&#x2019;ll never do that,&#x201d; she would add with a confident smile. &#x201c;You will always consider each other&#x2019;s feelings first.&#x201d; She had no idea about what was coming, crawling along on the tails of shadows toward our home and our family as we grew older.<br> <br>It was difficult, if not impossible, not to feel that we really were unique, and not just because we happened to be identical twins. Haylee liked to think we did have special powers, and for a long time, I believed it, too. We looked so alike that we could pretend we were looking in a mirror when we looked at each other. In fact, we rehearsed facing each other and moving our hands to points of our faces as if we were looking into a mirror. Mother&#x2019;s friends would roar with laughter, and Mother would look very proud when she had them over for a lunch during our younger years.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re so perfect,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d whisper, her eyes fixed on us. &#x201c;So perfect, down to every strand of hair.&#x201d;<br> <br>She would seize our right hands and turn them up so others could see our palms and then say, &#x201c;Look at the lines in their hands, how exact they are in depth and length. Not all identical twins are this exact,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d explain.<br> <br>Both of us did have some sense of difference simmering inside, though, and it grew stronger, of course, as we got older, despite Mother&#x2019;s efforts to smother it. It was destined to boil over, but in Haylee before me. Mother seemed unable to imagine that. She was so confident that she was right about how we would grow up and treat each other.<br> <br>I was convinced that she truly believed that Haylee and I had the same thoughts simultaneously. If one of us asked her a question, she would immediately look at the other&#x2019;s face to see if the same question was on her mind. Whether it was or not, she assumed it was. Daddy never did, but she was quick to point out how we both laughed at the same things on television and looked sad at the same sad things and wondered about the same things.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remarkable,&#x201d; she would say in a loud whisper.<br> <br>She often surprised us like that, commenting on some ordinary thing we had done together and giving us the feeling that it wasn&#x2019;t ordinary after all. Daddy would look at us again to see what she saw. Sometimes he would nod, but most of the time, he&#x2019;d shrug and say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not unusual, Keri. Kids are kids,&#x201d; and he&#x2019;d go on reading or doing whatever he had been doing. More than once, I caught Mother smirking at him with great displeasure when he did that.<br> <br>I often wondered why Daddy didn&#x2019;t think we were as special as Mother thought we were. Did that mean he loved us less? Why wasn&#x2019;t he as afraid of any differences we might show? In fact, whenever he could, especially when Mother wasn&#x2019;t watching or listening, he encouraged them, and because of that, Haylee loved him more. But I never believed he loved her more than he loved me, which was what she often claimed.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t easy for him to applaud our differences. Keeping us similar was so important to Mother that we were hardly ever alone when we were very young. It seemed she was always there hovering over us, watching carefully, eager to pounce as soon as one of us began to do something different from the other. If I reached for a cracker and she saw me do it, she would hold the box out to Haylee, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;...</p><h2>Repairing Old Clocks and Watches</h2><p>Discusses the tools, materials and techniques used in cleaning and repairing old timepieces, and includes tips on building necessary equipment</p><p>At the time of writing Repairing Old Clocks and Watches Anthony Whiten was running his own retail ironmongery business.

B. Kerr, he is the author of the much-loved young adult series Children of the Lamp. He lives in London.<b>Chapter 1.</b><br> I awoke from a long but agitated sleep to a world that was black and white but mostly black, with silver piping. I&#x2019;d stolen some Luminal from General Heydrich&#x2019;s country house outside Prague to help me sleep. He didn&#x2019;t need it for the simple reason that he was dead and I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have stolen it from him otherwise. But pills were even harder to get than booze which, like everything else, was in short supply and I needed them because as an officer in the SD I was a part of the horror now, much more than Heydrich. He was dead, buried the month before with full military honors with a clove of garlic in his mouth and a stake through his heart. He was well out of it, his last thoughts of revenge upon his Czech assassins still suspended inside his elongated El Greco head like so much frozen gray mud and there was no more harm he could do anyone. But in my wretched efforts to stay alive at almost any cost I could still hurt and be hurt in my turn, and as long as death&#x2019;s black barrel organ was playing it seemed I would have to dance to the cheerless, doom-filled tune that was turning inexorably on the drum, like some liveried monkey with a terrified rictus on its face and a tin cup in its hand. That didn&#x2019;t make me unusual; just German.<br><br> Berlin had a haunted look that summer, as if behind every tree and around each street corner was a screaming skull or some wide-eyed and shape-shifting <i>alp</i>. Sometimes when I woke in my bed at the flat in Fasanenstrasse, soaked with sweat, it was as if I&#x2019;d had some demon sitting on my chest, crushing the breath out of me and, in my rush to draw a breath and check that I was still alive, I often heard myself cry out and reach to grab at the sour air I had exhaled during the day, which was when I slept. And usually I lit a cigarette with the alacrity of someone who needed the tobacco smoke to breathe a little more comfortably and to help overcome the omnipresent taste of mass murder and human decay that stayed in my mouth like an old and rotten tooth.<br><br> The summer sunshine brought no joy. It seemed to exercise a sinister effect, making Berliners irritable with the broiling heat because there was nothing but water to drink, and reminding them always of how much hotter it probably was on the dry steppes of Russia and Ukraine, where our boys were now fighting a battle that already looked like much more than we had bargained for. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows in the tenement streets around Alexanderplatz and played tricks on your eyes, so that the phosphenes on your retinas - the after-effects of the mercilessly bright light - seemed to become the greenish auras of so many dead men. It was in the shadows where I belonged and where I felt comfortable, like an old spider that simply wants to be left alone. Only there wasn&#x2019;t much chance of that. It always paid to be careful what you were good at in Germany. Once I&#x2019;d been a good detective in Kripo, but that was a while ago, before the criminals wore smart gray uniforms and nearly everyone locked up was innocent. Being a Berlin cop in 1942 was a little like putting down mousetraps in a cage full of tigers. <br><br> On Heydrich&#x2019;s orders I&#x2019;d been working nights at the police praesidium on Alexanderplatz, which suited me just fine. There was no proper police work to speak of but I had little or no appetite for the company of my Nazi colleagues or their callous conversation. The Murder Commission, what remained of it &#x2013;which existed to investigate homicides - left me to my own devices, like a forgotten prisoner whose face meant death for anyone unwise enough to catch a glimpse of it. I was none too fond of it myself. Unlike Hamburg and Bremen, there were no night-time air-raids to speak of, which left the city sepulchrally quiet, so very different from the Berlin of the Weimar years when it had been the noisiest and most exciting city on earth. All that neon, all that jazz, and more especially all that freedom when nothing was hidden and nobody had to hide who or what they were &#x2013; it was hard to believe things had ever been like that. But Weimar Berlin had suited me better. The Weimar Republic had been the most democratic of democracies and yet, like all great democracies, it had been a little out of control. Prior to 1933, anything was permitted since as Socrates learned to his cost, the true nature of democracy is to encourage corruption and excess in all its forms. But the corruption and excesses of Weimar were still preferable to the Biblical abominations now perpetrated in the name of the Nuremberg Laws. I don&#x2019;t think I ever knew what mortal sin really meant until I lived in Nazi Germany. <br><br> Sometimes, when I stared out of my office window at night I caught sight of my own reflection staring back at me &#x2013; the same but different, like another ill-defined version of myself, a darker alter-ego, my evil twin or perhaps a harbinger of death. Now and then I heard this ghostly, etiolated double speak sneeringly to me: &#x201c;Tell me, Gunther, just what will you have to do and whose arse will you kiss to save your miserable skin today?&#x201d;<br><br> It was a good question.<br><br> From my office eyrie in the east corner tower of police headquarters I could more often hear the sound of steam trains pulling in and out of the station on Alexanderplatz. You could just see the roof &#x2013; what was left of it &#x2013; of the old orthodox synagogue on Kaiser-Strasse, which I think had been there since before the Franco-Prussian war and was one of the largest synagogues in Germany, with as many as eighteen-hundred worshippers. Which is to say, Jews. The Kaiser-Strasse synagogue was on a beat I&#x2019;d patrolled as a young Schupo in the early twenties.<br><br> Sometimes I would chat to some of the boys who attended the Jewish Boys&#x2019; School and who used to go trainspotting at the station. Once, another uniformed copper saw me talking to those boys and asked, &#x201c;what do you find to talk about with these Jews, anyway?&#x201d; And I&#x2019;d replied that they were just children and that we had talked about what you talk about with any other children. Of course, all that was before I found out that I had a trickle of Jew blood myself. Still, maybe it explains why I was nice to them. But I prefer to think it doesn&#x2019;t explain very much at all.<br><br> It had been a while since I&#x2019;d seen any Jewish boys on Kaiser-Strasse. Since the beginning of June they&#x2019;d been deporting Berlin&#x2019;s Jews from a transit camp at Grosse Hamburger Strasse to destinations somewhere in the east, although it was becoming better known that the destinations were more final than some nebulous compass-point. Mostly the deportations were made at night when there was no one around to see it done but one morning, at about five a.m., when I was checking out a pretty theft at Anhalter Station, I saw about fifty elderly Jews being loaded into closed cars on an impatient train. They looked like something Pieter Brueghel might have painted back in a time when Europe was a much more barbarous place than it is now &#x2013; when kings and emperors committed their black crimes in the open light of day, and not at a time when no one was yet out of bed to see them. The cars didn&#x2019;t seem so bad but by then I had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen to those Jews, which I expect was more than they did otherwise I can&#x2019;t imagine they&#x2019;d ever have boarded those trains.<br><br> I was on the point of being moved along by an old Berlin Schupo until I flashed him my beer-token and told him to go and fuck himself. <br><br> &#x201c;Sorry sir,&#x201d; he said, touching his leather shako smartly, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you was RSHA.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s this lot headed?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Somewhere in Bohemia. Thereisinstadt, I think they said it&#x2019;s called. You feel almost sorry for them, don&#x2019;t you? But I reckon it&#x2019;s better for them and for us, really. I mean, us Germans. They&#x2019;ll have a better life there, living among their own in a new town, won&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not in Thereisinstadt they won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just got back from Bohemia.&#x201d; And then I told him all I knew about the place and a bit more besides, about what was happening in Russia and Ukraine. The look of horror on the man&#x2019;s florid face was almost worth the risk I took in telling him the unvarnished and unpalatable truth.<br><br> &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be serious,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, but I am. It&#x2019;s fact that we&#x2019;re systematically murdering people by the thousands out there, in the swamps east of Poland. I know. I&#x2019;ve seen it for myself. And by &#x2018;we&#x2019; I mean us, the police. The RSHA. It&#x2019;s us that&#x2019;s doing the murdering.&#x201d;<br><br> The Schupo blinked hard and looked as if I&#x2019;d said something incomprehensible. &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be true, what you just said, sir. Surely you&#x2019;re joking.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not joking. What I just told you is the one true thing you&#x2019;ll probably hear today. Just ask around, only try to do it discretely. People don&#x2019;t like talking about this, for obvious reasons. You could get into trouble. We both could. I&#x2019;m telling you, those Jews are on a slow train to hell. And so are we.&#x201d;<br><br> I walked away smiling sadistically to myself; in Nazi Germany truth makes a&nbsp; powerful weapon.<br> But it was one of those RSHA murderers who brought me in from the cold. An Austrian, Ernst Kaltenbrunner was rumored to be the next chief of the Reich Main Office for Security &#x2013; the RHSA - but the same rumor said that his appointment could not be approved by Hitler until the man had finished drying out at a sanatorium in Chur, Switzerland. This left Kripo in the forensically capable if thoroughly murderous hands of General Arthur Nebe who, until the previous November, had commanded SS Operation Group B in Byelorussia. Group B was now commanded by someone else but if what was bruited about the Alex was correct &#x2013; and I had good reason to think it probably was &#x2013; Nebe&#x2019;s men had killed more than forty-five thousand people before he finally earned his ticket back to Berlin. <br><br> Forty-five thousand. A number like that was hard to comprehend in the context of murder.<br><br> Berlin&#x2019;s Sportspalast, where the Nazis held some of their rallies, had a capacity of fourteen thousand. Three whole Sportspalasts full of people who were there to cheer a speech by Goebbels. That&#x2019;s what forty-five thousand looked like. Except none of those murdered had cheered, of course.<br><br> I wondered what Nebe told his wife, Elise and his daughter, Gisela about what he&#x2019;d been doing out in Ivan&#x2019;s swamps. Gisela was a beautiful young woman of seventeen now and I knew Arthur doted on her. She was intelligent, too. Did she ever ask him about his work in the SS? Or did she see something elusive in her father&#x2019;s fox-like eyes and then just talk about something else, the way people used to do when the subject of the Great War had come up in conversation. I never knew anyone who was comfortable talking about that, certainly not me. If you hadn&#x2019;t been in the trenches there was no point in expecting anyone even to imagine what it was like. Not that Arthur Nebe had anything to feel ashamed about back then; as a young lieutenant in his pioneer battalion with the 17th Army (1st West Prussian) Corps on the eastern front, he&#x2019;d been gassed twice and won a first class Iron Cross. Nebe was none too fond of the Russians as a result but it was unthinkable that he would ever have told his family that he&#x2019;d spent the summer of 1941 murdering forty-five thousand Jews. But Nebe knew that I knew and somehow he could still look me in the eye; and while we didn&#x2019;t talk about it, what was surprising to me more than him was the fact that I could tolerate his company, just about. &nbsp;I figured that if I could work for Heydrich I could work for anyone. I wouldn&#x2019;t say we were ever friends, Nebe and me. We got along all right although I never understood how someone who had plotted against Hitler as early as 1938 could have become a mass-murderer with such apparent equanimity. Nebe had tried to explain this, when we were in Minsk. He&#x2019;d told me that he needed to keep his remarkable nose clean long enough for him and his friends to get another opportunity to kill Hitler; I just didn&#x2019;t see how that justified the murders of forty-five thousand Jews. I didn&#x2019;t understand it then and I don&#x2019;t understand now. <br><br> At Nebe&#x2019;s suggestion we met for Sunday lunch in a private room at Wirtshaus Moorlake, a little southwest of Pfauensinsel, on the Wannsee. With an attractive beer garden and an orchestra it looked more Bavarian than Prussian and was very popular with Berliners in the summer. This summer was no exception. It was a beautiful day and neither of us was wearing a uniform. Nebe was dressed in a three piece, belt-back Knickerbocker suit made of light gray hound&#x2019;s-tooth tweed, with button pockets and peak lapels. With his light gray stockings and polished brown brogues, he looked like he was planning to shoot something with feathers, which would certainly have made a welcome change. I was wearing my summer suit, which was the same three-piece, pin-stripe, navy suit I wore in winter except that I had neglected to wear the vest as a concession to the warmer weather; I looked as sharp as a seagull&#x2019;s feather and I didn&#x2019;t care who knew it.<br> We ate lake trout with potatoes and strawberries with cream, and enjoyed two bottles of good Mosel. After lunch we took a longish sort of boat or shell on the water. Because of my extensive naval experience Nebe let me row of course, although it might have had as much to do with me being a captain and him a general; and while I applied myself to the oars he smoked a large Havana cigar and stared up at an unblemished Prussian blue sky as if he didn&#x2019;t have a care in the world. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t. Conscience was a luxury that few officers in the SS and SD could afford. The Wannsee looked like an impressionist painting of some idyllic scene on the River Seine at the turn of the century, the kind that looks like the picture is suffering from a severe case of spots. <br><br>There were canoes and out-rigged shells, sailing boats, and sloops, but no boats that required petrol: petrol was even harder to get than pills and booze. There were plenty of young women around, too&nbsp; - which was one of the reasons Nebe liked it there &#x2013; but no young men; they were all in uniform and probably fighting for their lives in some Russian shellhole. The women in the long narrow shells wore white singlets and the briefest of shorts, which were an improvement on corsets and French bustles because they showed off their breasts and behinds to anyone like me who was interested in that kind of thing; they were tanned and vigorous and sometimes flirtatious, too; they were only human after all and craved male attention almost as much as I craved the chance to give it to them. Some of them rowed alongside us for a while and made conversation until they realized just how old we were; I was in my forties and I think Nebe must have been almost fifty. But there was one girl who took my eye. I recognized her as someone who lived not so far away from me. I knew her name was Kirsten and she was a school teacher at the Fichte Gymnasium on Emser Strasse. Seeing her row I resolved to see a little more of Emser Strasse and perhaps, by some happy accident, her. After she and her lithe companions pushed off I kept an eye on their boat, just in case; you never know when a beautiful girl is going to fall in the water and need rescuing. &nbsp;<br><br> Another reason Nebe liked it ...</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Cyprus</h2><p>&#34;The DK Eyewitness Cyprus Travel Guide&#34; will lead you straight to the best attractions Cyprus has to offer.

Yet, even as the Gestapo posted his photo in public, he lived a daringly adventurous life, replete with fine restaurants and beautiful women, all the while managing to elude the Nazis. Breathtakingly bold, Schï¿½nhaus talked his way out of an arrest, defended Jewish diners being harassed by the police, and ultimately fled Germany by bicycling to Switzerland. Schï¿½nhaus&#39;s story-his courageous exploits that saved so many, as many others around him were deported, one by one, to the concentration camps-is an astonishing tale of wartime heroism and survival.</p><p><b>Cioma Schï¿½nhaus</b> was born in Berlin in 1922. While on the Gestapo's wanted list, he escaped, with forged papers, to Switzerland, where he still lives.This memoir of a Jewish man's experience in wartime Berlin is less a tale of suffering than of courage. By 1942, Schï¿½nhaus's family had been deported; the 20-year-old was spared because he worked in an arms factory. In that year, he began using his graphics background to forge IDs for Jews in hiding, and eventually went underground himself. His efforts, aided by anti-Nazi Germans, saved the lives of hundreds of Jews. He maintains a determined tone about the war&#x2014;At last, I didn't have to just look on helplessly at what they were doing to us, he writes about being asked to forge documents&#x2014;but Schï¿½nhaus's account has all the elements of a thriller. (In fact, Schï¿½nhaus's story is being made into a film.) Despite the doom around him, he lives boldly, enjoying sailing escapades and sexual encounters with women, seemingly defying the Nazi authorities to find him until he flees over the border into Switzerland. While adding to our knowledge about wartime Berlin, this work also tells us something about how the human spirit can thrive amid destruction and tragedy. <i>(Feb. 1) </i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Julius Caesar has been cut down. His blood stains the hands of a cabal of bold conspirators, led by famed general Marcus Brutuswhom Caesar once called a friend. Have these self-proclaimed liberators bravely slain a power-mad tyrant or brutally murdered the beloved Father of Rome? Hailed as heroes by a complicit Senate and granted amnesty, the killers eagerly turn toward plotting the empires future under their control. But Caesars death does not rest easily with all of Rome. For two men whose bonds of friendship, family, and fidelity to the emperor are unbreakable, the shocking assassination is nothing less than treason. And those responsible must pay with their lives. Through countless battles and years of peace, Marc Antony has wielded a sword and raised a cup at Caesars side. Now, in the wake of the cold-blooded coup, he is powerless against the political might of Brutus and his treacherous senators. Yet, with no weapons other than eloquence and outrage, Antony will turn the tide of public opinion and spark a rebellion that will set the streets of Rome ablaze. At the same time, Gaius Octavian, adopted son and chosen heir of Caesar, has gained wealth beyond imagining and influence throughout Roman dominions. But the soul-deep wound of his fathers death will never be healed by gold or power. He will rest only with the blood of the killers on his blade. Drawn together by their common cause, Antony and Octavian marshal their forces into an avenging army on a mission to reunite all that Caesars fall has torn asunder. Even as his cohorts flee for their livesor fall prey to vigilantesa defiant Brutus vows never to relinquish what his ruthless ambition has won him. As opposing legions join in mortal combat, the destiny of Rome will turn on which of their commanders is the mightiest and most cunning. Marking the authors triumphant return to the setting of his celebrated Emperor series, The Blood of Gods unfolds with unmatched power, electric with the high-adventure storytelling, captivating historical detail, and stirring battle scenes for which Conn Iggulden is renowned.</p><p>Conn Iggulden is the author of the Emperor series, as well as the Khan Dynasty novels. He is also the co-author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Dangerous Book for Boys, The Dangerous Book of Heroes,</i> and <i>Tollins: Explosive Tales for Children.</i> He lives with his wife and children in Hertfordshire, England, where he is working on his next book.Part One<br>Chapter 1<br><br>Octavian winced as he felt the heat of the rocks burning through his thin sandals. Though Rome claimed to have finally brought civilization to Greece, he could see little sign of it in the hill villages. Away from the coast, the people were either suspicious of strangers or openly hostile. Even a simple request to use a well was met with frowns and doors shut in their faces. All the while, the sun beat down, reddening their necks. Octavian remembered how he had smiled when the local praetor said there were places in Greece where a young Roman had about as much chance of survival as a tax-ï¿½gatherer. It had been an exaggeration, but not by much.<br><br>He stopped to wipe sweat from his face. The land itself was wild, with canyons that seemed to drop forever. Octavian took a deep breath, suddenly certain he&#x2019;d be walking out. Nothing would give the local boys more pleasure than seeing three footsore Romans searching for stolen mounts.<br><br>Octavian stayed alert as he climbed, looking for some sign of the group of ragged men they followed. The trail had been easy at first, until it split and split again. Octavian didn&#x2019;t know if the bandits knew they would be pursued or had just taken different routes home, vanishing into the cauldron of mountains as their ancestors had done for thousands of years. He felt an itch and craned his neck to see as far as he could. It was too easy to imagine a bowman leaning over the lip of some crag and attacking before they even knew he was there.<br><br>&#x201c;Call out if you see anything,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Maecenas snorted, waving a hand at bare rocks. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a tracker,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;For all I know, they could have passed through here with a herd of goats just an hour ago. Why don&#x2019;t we go back to the main group and take up the search from there? This is not how I expected to spend my leave. I imagined more wine and less . . . climbing.&#x201d; He grunted as they reached a great step in the rocks.<br><br>There was no sign of a path and each man heaved himself up, their sandals skidding and scrambling as they went. The sun was fierce above and the sky was an aching blue. All three were sweating heavily and the single flask of water was already empty.<br><br>&#x201c;At least the men from the town know these hills,&#x201d; Maecenas went on. &#x201c;They know where to search.&#x201d;<br><br>Octavian didn&#x2019;t have the breath to respond. The slope grew steeper and steeper until he had to use his hands to steady each step, then really climb. He was panting lightly as he reached the top of a crag and stared, judging the best route down the other side. The maze of gray rocks stretched into the distance, empty of life beyond the lizards that skittered away with every step.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have me stand by and watch, doing nothing to help them?&#x201d; Octavian said suddenly. &#x201c;A rape and a murder, Maecenas. You saw her body. What honor would there be in letting a few farmers chase them down while we stand and watch, confirming everything they say about idle Romans? Come on.&#x201d;<br><br>He jerked his head at a route that would take them to the floor of the canyon and began climbing down. At least the shadowed clefts were cooler, until they climbed back into the burning sun once more.<br><br>&#x201c;Why should I care what Greek peasants say?&#x201d; Maecenas muttered, though he pitched his voice too low to be heard. Maecenas was of such ancient lineage that he refused to claim descent from the twins who suckled at a she-ï¿½wolf and went on to found Rome. His people, he said, had owned the wolf. When they&#x2019;d first met, he&#x2019;d assumed Octavian had known Caesar, so a mere Roman noble could not impress him. Over time, he&#x2019;d realized Octavian took Maecenas at the value he set for himself. It was slightly galling to have to live up to his own sense of superiority. Maecenas felt that Octavian had rather missed the point of noble families. It wasn&#x2019;t who you were&#x2014;ï¿½it was who your ancestors had been that mattered. Yet somehow that simple faith was something he could not shatter in his friend. Octavian had known poverty, with his father dying early. If he thought a true Roman noble would be brave and honorable, Maecenas didn&#x2019;t want to disappoint him.<br><br>Maecenas sighed at the thought. They wore simple tunics and darker leggings. Any clothing was too hot for climbing in the noon sun, but the leggings were terrible, already dark with perspiration. He was convinced he&#x2019;d rubbed himself raw under them. He could smell his own sweat as he climbed and skidded down, wrinkling his nose in distaste. The scabbard of his sword caught in a crevice and Maecenas swore as he freed it. His expression darkened as he heard Agrippa laugh behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;I am glad to provide some amusement for you, Agrippa,&#x201d; he snapped. &#x201c;The pleasures of this day are now complete.&#x201d;<br><br>Agrippa gave a tight smile without replying as he came level and then went past, using his great strength and size to take enormous steps down the crag. The fleet centurion was a head taller than his companions and the constant labor on board Roman galleys had only increased the power in his arms and legs. He made the climb look easy and was still breathing lightly by the time he reached the bottom. Octavian was a few steps behind and the pair waited for Maecenas as he clambered down after them.<br><br>&#x201c;You realize we&#x2019;ll have to go back up that hill again when we turn around?&#x201d; Maecenas said as he jumped the last few feet.<br><br>Octavian groaned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to argue with you, Maecenas. It would be easier if you just accepted we are doing this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Without complaining,&#x201d; Agrippa added. His deep voice echoed back from the stone all around them and Maecenas looked sourly at them both.<br><br>&#x201c;There are a thousand different paths through these cursed rocks,&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;I should think the bandits are far away from here by now, sipping cool drinks while we die of thirst.&#x201d;<br><br>Gleefully, Agrippa pointed at the dusty ground and Maecenas looked down, seeing the footprints of many men.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. He drew his sword in a smooth motion, as if he expected an immediate attack. &#x201c;Probably local herders, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Octavian replied, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;re the only ones following this path, so I would like to be sure.&#x201d; He too drew his gladius, shorter than Maecenas&#x2019;s duelist&#x2019;s blade by a hand&#x2019;s breadth, but well oiled, so that it slid free with barely a whisper. He could feel the heat of the blade.<br><br>Agrippa freed his own sword and together the three men walked silently into the canyon ahead, placing their steps with caution. Without planning it, Octavian took the lead, with Agrippa&#x2019;s bulk on his right shoulder and Maecenas on his left. Ever since they had become friends, Octavian had led the group as if there were no alternative. It was the kind of natural confidence Maecenas appreciated and recognized. Old families had to start somewhere, even when they began with a Caesar. He smiled at the thought, though the expression froze as they came around a spire of rock and saw men waiting for them in the shadows. Octavian walked on without a jerk, keeping his sword lowered. Three more steps brought him into the gloom of the chasm, with rock walls stretching up above their heads. He came to a halt, looking coldly at the men in his way.<br><br>There was another path out on the other side and Maecenas noticed laden mules waiting patiently. The men they faced did not seem surprised or afraid, perhaps because there were eight of them, staring with bright-ï¿½eyed interest at the three young Romans. The biggest of the men raised a sword from another age, a great length of iron that was more like a cleaver than anything else. He sported a black beard that reached right down to his chest and Maecenas could see the bulge of heavy muscles under a ragged jerkin as he moved. The man grinned at them, revealing missing teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;You are a very long way from your friends,&#x201d; the man said in Greek.<br><br>Maecenas knew the language, though Octavian and Agrippa spoke not a word. Neither of them looked around with so many blades being pointed in their direction, but Maecenas could feel their expectation.<br><br>&#x201c;Must I translate?&#x201d; he said, dredging up the words from his memory. &#x201c;I know the high speech, but your peasant accent is so thick, I can hardly understand you. It is like the grunting of a dying mule. Speak slowly and clearly, as if you were apologizing to your master.&#x201d;<br><br>The man looked at him in surprise, anger darkening his face. He was aware that the death of Romans would make him a wanted man, but the mountains had hidden bodies before and would again. He tilted his head slightly, weighing his choices.<br><br>&#x201c;We want the one who raped and strangled the woman,&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;Hand him over to us and go back to your short and pointless lives.&#x201d;<br><br>The leader of the bandits growled deep in his throat and took a step forward.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you saying to him?&#x201d; Octavian asked without taking his eyes off the man.<br><br>&#x201c;I am praising his fine beard,&#x201d; Maecenas replied. &#x201c;I have never seen one like it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maecenas!&#x201d; Octavian snapped. &#x201c;It has to be them. Just find out if he knows the one we came to find.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, beard? Do you know the one we want?&#x201d; Maecenas went on, switching languages.<br><br>&#x201c;I am the one you want, Roman,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But if you have come here alone, you have made a mistake.&#x201d;<br><br>The bandit looked up the rocks to the blue sky, searching for any hint of a moving shadow that would reveal an ambush or a trap. He grunted, satisfied, then glanced at his sharp-ï¿½eyed companions. One of them was dark and thin, his face dominated by a great blade of a nose. In response, the man shrugged, raising a dagger with unmistakable intent.<br><br>Octavian stepped forward without warning of any kind. With a vicious flick, he brought his sword across so that it cut the throat of the closest man to him. The man dropped his dagger to hold his neck with both hands, suddenly choking as he fell to his knees.<br><br>The leader of the bandits froze, then gave a great bellow of rage with the rest of his men. He raised his sword for a crushing blow, but Agrippa jumped in, gripping the sword arm with his left hand and stabbing his short blade up between the man&#x2019;s ribs. The leader collapsed like a punctured wineskin, falling onto his back with an echoing crash.<br><br>For a heartbeat, the bandits hesitated, shocked by the explosion of violence and death. Octavian had not stopped moving. He killed another gaping bandit with a backhand stroke against his throat, chopping into flesh. He&#x2019;d set his feet well and brought the whole of his strength into the blow, so that it almost decapitated the man. The gladius was made for such work and the weight felt good in his hand.<br><br>The rest might have run then, if their way hadn&#x2019;t been blocked by their own mules. Forced to stand, they fought with vicious intensity for desperate moments as the three Romans lunged and darted among them. All three had been trained from a young age. They were professional soldiers and the bandits were more used to frightening villagers who would not dare to raise a blade against them. They fought hard but uselessly, seeing their blades knocked away and then unable to stop the return blows cutting them. The small canyon was filled with grunting and gasping as the bandits were cut down in short, chopping blows. None of the Romans was armored, but they stood close to one another, protecting their left sides as the swords rose and fell, with warm blood slipping off the warmer steel.<br><br>It was over in a dozen heartbeats and Octavian, Agrippa, and Maecenas were alone and panting. Octavian and Agrippa were both bleeding from gashes on their arms, but they were unaware of the wounds, still grim-ï¿½eyed with the violence.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take the heads back,&#x201d; Octavian said. &#x201c;The woman&#x2019;s husband will want to see them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All of them?&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;One is enough, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>Octavian looked at his friend, then reached out and gripped his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve done well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thank you. But we can make a sack from their clothing. I want that village to know that Romans killed these men. They will remember&#x2014;ï¿½and I suspect they will break out the casks of their best wine and slaughter a couple of goats or pigs as well. You might even find a willing girl. Just take the heads.&#x201d;<br><br>Maecenas grimaced. He&#x2019;d spent his childhood with servants to attend to every whim, yet somehow Octavian had him working and sweating like a house slave. If his old tutors could see him, they would be standing in slack-ï¿½jawed amazement.<br><br>&#x201c;The daughters have mustaches as thick as their fathers&#x2019;,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Perhaps when it&#x2019;s fully dark, but not before.&#x201d;<br><br>With a scowl, he began the grisly work of cutting heads. Agrippa joined him, bringing his sword down in great hacking blows to break through bone.<br><br>Octavian knelt next to the body of the bandit leader, looking down into the glazed eyes for a moment. He nodded to himself, playing over the movements of the fight in his head and only then noticing the gash on his arm that was still bleeding heavily. At twenty years old, it was not the first time he&#x2019;d been cut. It was just one more scar to add to the rest. He began to chop the head free, using the oily beard to hold it steady.<br><br>The horses were still there when they came back, parched and staggering, with their tongues swelling in their mouths. It was sunset by the time the three Romans reached the village, with two sopping red sacks that dribbled their contents with every step. The local men had returned angry and empty-ï¿½handed, but the mood changed when Octavian opened the sacks onto the road, sending heads tumbling into the dust. The woman&#x2019;s husband embraced and kissed him with tears in his eyes, breaking off only to dash the heads against the wall of his house, then crushing Octavian to him once more. There was no need to translate as they left the man and his children to their mourning.<br><br>The other villagers brought food and drinks from cool cellars, setting up rough tables in the evening air so that they could feast the young men. As Octavian had imagined, he and his friends could hardly move for good meat and a clear drink that tasted of aniseed. They drank with no thought for the morning, matching the local men cup for cup until the village swam and blurred before their eyes. Very few of the villagers could speak Roman, but it didn&#x2019;t seem to matter.<br><br>Through a drunken haze, Octavian became aware that Maecenas was repeating a question to him. He listened blearily, then gave a laugh, which turned into a curse at his own clumsiness as he spilled his cup.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t believe that,&#x201d; he told Maecenas. &#x201c;They call it the eternal city for a reason. There will be Romans here for a thousand years, longer. Or do you think some other nation will rise up and be our masters?&#x201d; He watched his cup being refilled with beady concentration.<br><br>&#x201c;Athens, Sparta, Thebes . . .&#x201d; Maecenas replied, counting on his fingers. &#x201c;Names of gold, Octavian. No doubt the men of those cities thought the same. When Alexander was wasting his life in battles abroad, do you think he would have believed Romans would one day rule their lands from coast to coast? He would have laughed like a donkey, much as you are doing.&#x201d; Maecenas smiled as he spoke, enjoying making his friend splutter into his cup with each outrageous comment.<br><br>&#x201c;Wasting his life?&#x201d; Octavian said when he had recovered from coughing. &#x201c;You are seriously suggesting Alexander the Great could have spent his years more fruitfully? I will not rise to it. I will be a stern and noble Roman, too . . .&#x201d; He paused. The drink had muddled his thoughts. &#x201c;Too stern and noble to listen to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Alexander had the greedy fingers of a merchant,&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;Always busy, busy, and what did it get him? All those years of fighting, but if he had ...</p><h2>Lasting Impressions: Colin Campbell Cooper</h2><p>This catalog is published in conjunction with the exhibition Lasting Impressions: Colin Campbell Cooper.

Includes art created by teacher and students, excerpts from diaries, and interviews with camp survivors.</p><p>Susan Goldman Rubin has written several highly praised biographies for children. These include "Frank Lloyd Wright" and "Margaret Bourke-White": "Her Pictures Were Her Life", which "Booklist" called in a starred review, "one of the best biographies of the year." Her other works include "Toilets, Toasters &amp; Telephones": "The How and Why of Everyday Objects" and two young adults novels, "Emily Good as Gold" and "Emily in Love"."Of the 15,000 children who passed through Terezin, only 100 survived. But their artwork and writings live on as testimony to their lives and spirits." This heartbreaking picture book tells the children's story by focusing on their remarkable art teacher, Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, a Jewish artist from Czechoslovakia, who took art supplies and books with her to the concentration camp and ran secret classes for the children. She and nearly all her pupils perished at Auschwitz, but after the war, 5,000 of the children's drawings, paintings, and collages were discovered hidden in two suitcases. The pictures are now exhibited around the world, and many of them are beautifully reproduced on the pages of this book. Some of the work is naive in style; some is sophisticated. There are portraits, self-portraits, and pictures that show horrific camp conditions and dreams of home (for example, a family Passover supper). The facts, including the dates, in the brief captions make you return to the pictures ("Robert Bondy painted empty landscapes over and over again with his village in the distance"). Rubin interviewed several survivors, and she integrates their personal testimonies with the history of the camp. This is an excellent book to use across the curriculum in Holocaust studies, in art, history, and literature classes with middle-grade and older readers. Rubin's detailed references and sources include books, documentary films and videos, and Web sites to help students who want to know more. There's no sensationalism here. Everything is distanced, but the sense of loss is overwhelming. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

I promise to do my best not to entertain you."</i><p> A slightly forbidding introduction to a book, but indicative of its author's disgust at the homogenized McWorld in which we live, and an enticing challenge to read on. As the title <i>The Twilight of American Culture</i> suggests, Morris Berman's outlook is somewhat bleak. Analogizing the contemporary United States to the late Roman Empire, Berman sees a nation fat on useless consumption, saturated with corporate ideology, and politically, psychically, and culturally dulled. But he believes that this behemoth--what Thomas Frank called the "multinational entertainment oligopoly"--must buckle under its own weight. His hope for a brighter tomorrow lies in a modern monastic movement, in which keepers of the enlightenment flame resist the constant barrage of "spin and hype." Ironically, despite his disdain for "the fashionable patois of postmodernism," he approvingly quotes poststructuralist theorist Jean-Franï¿½ois Lyotard's maxim "elitism for everybody" in describing this cadre of idiosyncratic, literate devotees, these new monks.</p><p> Berman is plainspoken and occasionally caustic. <i>The Twilight of American Culture</i> is an informed and thought-provoking book, a wake-up call to a nation whose powerful minority has become increasingly self-satisfied as their stock options ripen, while an underclass that vastly outnumbers the e-generation withers on the vine and cannot locate itself on any map. It is a quick and savage read that aims to get your eyes off this computer, your nose out of that self-help book, and send you back to thought and action. <i>--J.R.</i></p>Morris Berman is a cultural historian and the author of The Twilight of American Culture.

Born into a privileged Unitarian family, Potter, along with her younger brother, Walter Bertram (1872-1918), grew up with few friends outside her large extended family. Her parents were artistic, interested in nature and enjoyed the countryside. As children, Beatrix and Bertram had numerous small animals as pets which they observed closely and drew endlessly. Summer holidays were spent in Scotland and in the English Lake District where Beatrix developed a love of the natural world which was the subject of her painting from an early age. Although she was provided with private art lessons, Potter preferred to develop her own style, particularly favouring watercolour. Along with her drawings of her animals, real and imagined, she illustrated insects, fossils, archeological artefacts, and fungi. In the 1890s her mycological illustrations and research on the reproduction of fungi spores generated interest from the scientific establishment. Following some success illustrating cards and booklets, Potter wrote and illustrated The Tale of Peter Rabbit publishing it first privately in 1901, and a year later as a small, three-colour illustrated book with Frederick Warne &amp; Co. Potter published over twenty-three books; the best known are those written between 1902 and 1922. She died on 22 December 1943 at her home in Near Sawrey at age 77, leaving almost all her property to the National Trust. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now comprises the Lake District National Park. Potter's books continue to sell throughout the world, in multiple languages. Her stories have been retold in song, film, ballet and animation.</p><p></p><h2>Van Life /anglais</h2><p>Beautifully illustrated with photos of retro vans and their owners, this collection is from the creator of the hashtag #vanlife, and is as much about exploring nature as it is about what &#39;rig&#39; you drive &#39; The Pool More and more people are taking a break from conventional life for the freedom and adventure of being on the road and living in a converted vintage truck, camper, or van.

What had Stengel ever done? His work managing the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves had been long on personality and remarkably short on success. They thought the Yankees would never be able to compete with the Red Sox or Indians with that broken-down old man in charge. At the All-Star break, the Yankees looked like a banged-up bunch of also-rans, not like a team about to embark on five straight championships. Yet Stengel seemed confident of success. As Steven Goldman explains, people had forgotten that Casey knew how to come back.<br><br>How did he know? Goldman refutes claims that anyone could have won with the Yankees. Casey knew how to win because of the years of struggle and ignominy, because he&#x2019;d learned how to manage by running two of the game&#x2019;s worst sad-sack franchises, because he had learned through failure. To understand Stengel&#x2019;s formative years, Goldman retraces Stengel&#x2019;s baseball education in playing for the great John McGraw, from whom he also learned that success permits no room for nostalgia. Goldman follows Stengel through his years with the Dodgers and Braves, his return to the minors, a spat with Bill Veeck, and his success as a businessman away from the diamond.<br><br><i>Forging Genius</i> gives insights to Stengel&#x2019;s irrepressible love of the game and his incorrigible desire to entertain. As Casey put it, &#x201c;Because I can make people laugh, some of them think I&#x2019;m a damn fool.&#x201d; His humor camouflaged a relentless hunger for success, glory, and the respectability he desperately sought. Goldman gives readers an unprecedented vision of one man&#x2019;s lifelong pursuit of genius on the baseball diamond.</p><p>Steven Goldman writes the column &#x201c;The Pinstriped Bible,&#x201d; a regular Web column for the New York Yankees focused on their history, and also contributes to <i>Yankees Magazine</i> and www.mlb.com. He lives in East Brunswick, New Jersey.&#34;Even the most fanatic Yankees fans will find themselves exclaiming, &#39;Wow!

With the exception of Freud, who chose him as the first president of the International Psychoanalytic Association, no psychologist has achieved more. Previous biographers have either made Jung an idol or condemned him for his failings. Ronald Hayman neither ignores Jung's faults nor exaggerates them in investigating the most crucial paradoxes surrounding this enigmatic figure. Hailed by Anthony Storr as "the best biography of Jung," Hayman's work is "all the more effective for its detached tone that perfectly puts in proportion Jung's cruel, brilliant and crazy schemes" (<em>The Times</em> [London]). Impeccably researched and written with notable objectivity, <em>A Life of Jung</em> offers a rare insight into how Jung's revolutionary ideas grew out of his own extraordinary experiences. "Compelling....Hayman captures...the extraordinary charisma of his subject."&#x2015;<em>Newsday</em> "Likely to become the standard biography of the revolutionary psychoanalyst."&#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em>, starred review 16 pages of illustrations</p><p>Ronald Hayman has authored numerous internationally acclaimed biographies, including works on Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Marcel Proust, Sylvia Plath, and Thomas Mann. He lives in London."The S.S. men are being transformed into a caste of knights ruling sixty million natives. [T]here is no more ideal form of government than a decent form of oligarchy," wrote Carl Jung of the German Nazis in the mid-1930s. One of the many strengths of this candid and discerning biography is that Hayman (Nietzsche: A Critical Life) enlists such provocative, alarming material to build a careful, nuanced portrait of his subject that neither excuses nor excoriates his actions and words. After studying psychiatry in Paris at the turn of the century (while also investigating the supernatural via s&#x201a;ances), Jung became an ardent admirer of Freud, with whom he agreed on many things (though Freud's emphasis on sexuality was a notable exception). Meanwhile, Jung pursued his own theories of the unconscious, using myth and archetype as models. His break with Freud before WWI was a defining moment in the development of his theory and his career. Without losing sight of Jung's total oeuvre, Hayman examines the enormous advantages Jung gained by maintaining ambiguous views of National Socialist policies. Indeed, Hayman shows how Hitler's attack on Jews gave Jung a chance to promote his own psychological theories (e.g., the defamation of Freud and other Jewish psychoanalysts led to the possibility for the ascendance of Jung's analytical psychology). Placing Jung's anti-Semitism in a broad cultural and professional context as well as exploring his other influences, including his complicated relationships with patients and disciples Hayman has produced a vital and moving portrait of the man and his time. While not detailed enough for scholars, this is a fine work for the general reader. 16 pages of photos not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>A Course In Enumeration (Sie) (Pb 2012)</h2><p>Combinatorial enumeration is a readily accessible subject full of easily stated, but sometimes tantalizingly difficult problems.

Incorporating snakes into a naturalistic vivarium, the way lizards and amphibians usually are, adds a new element to snake keeping, elevating the hobby to a true art form. In The Art of Keeping Snakes, de Vosjoli pursues this concept and provides advice for snake keepers who wish to create beautiful displays for their snakes, putting the animals&#x2019; welfare and quality of life above all else and simultaneously enhancing their own enjoyment in observing their beautiful snakes in naturalistic environments. Beautifully photographed, inspiring, and informative, The Art of Keeping Snakes is divided into two parts, the first A New Way to Keep Snakes,&#x201d; discusses design planning, enclosures and background possibilities, substrates, landscaping, plants, heating/lighting, quarantine and introducing the snakes to the vivarium. This part also includes chapters on feeding, handling, health care, and general maintenance and husbandry. The second part, Best Display Snakes,&#x201d; presents over thirty different snakes, including photographs, physical descriptions, and tips for selection, handling, vivarium design tips, feeding, and breeding. The snakes in this part are divided into chapters, categorized by pythons, boas, water and garter snakes, hognose snakes, rat snakes, kingsnakes and milksnakes, and others. Resources and index included.</p><p>Philippe de Vosjoli is a highly acclaimed author of the best-selling reptile-care books, The Herpetocultural Library Series.

On the harrowing voyage to the Americas, she is beaten for her unrelenting will and staunch pride. When she arrives, she gives birth to a daughter who is called Sapphire because of the "black-blue-black" complexion she shares with her mother. Sapphire has also inherited her mother's strength and defiant spirit, and despite a life of poverty and opression, she grows up to mother several daughters of her own. Even when tragedy strikes and part of Sapphire dies, her strength gives rise to a legend that will sustain the women who follow her, "each carrying something of her mother, her grandmother, her aunts; each passing on to her own daughters blessing and cursing, the consequences of her own choosing.<br><br>Through the lives of Sapphire and her descendants, Hilda Gurley-Highgate not only creates a poignant and engrossing saga of black women in America, she brilliantly illuminates the meaning of roots and the links between women and their female ancestors, a tie that often appears tenuous, undefined, and distant, but is strong, palpable, and much closer than we imagine.

In his first encyclical Pope Francis reflects on the meaning of faith, the beginning of God&#39;s gracious salvation.Faith is the means by which man encounters the living God through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit. Francis draws on key themes of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who wrote encyclicals on charity and hope. He intended to complete the set with a reflection on faith, which would also have underscored the Year of Faith that he launched. Benedict&#39;s history-making retirement meant he was unable to finish his encyclical. Francis took up the task, adding his own insights, themes, and emphases to the work begun by Benedict XVI.According to Pope Francis, Light of Faith is a four hand document. Pope Benedict, Francis notes, handed it to me, it is a strong document. He did the great amount of work. Thus, although officially Light of Faith (Lumen Fidei) is an encyclical of Pope Francis and reflects his teaching ministry, it is also reflects the work of Pope Emeritus Benedict. This is not only Francis&#39; first encyclical; it is also the first encyclical to have been openly written by two successors of St. Peter.There is an urgent need, then, to see once again that faith is a light, for once the flame of faith dies out, all other lights begin to dim. The light of faith is unique, since it is capable of illuminating every aspect of human existence. A light this powerful cannot come from ourselves but from a more primordial source: in a word, it must come from God. Faith is born of an encounter with the living God who calls us and reveals his love, a love which precedes us and upon which we can lean for security and for building our lives. - Pope Francis</p><p><p><b>Pope Francis</b> (Jorge Mario Bergoglio), is the first Jesuit and the first Latin American to be elected to the chair of Peter.

The carved mahogany mantelpiece in one of the two front parlors had been polished until it sparkled, its carved rosettes and female busts oiled to perfection. The long marquetry table in the center of the room was equally handsome and had been equally well tended, although it was almost impossible to see it beneath the neat stacks of treasures that had been gathering there for weeks. Carved jades, enormous silver platters, lace tablecloths, two dozen magnificently carved crystal bowls, and at least three dozen silver salt and pepper shakers, and fourteen silver candelabra. The wedding gifts were lined up on the table, as though waiting for inspection and at the end of the table a pad and black fountain pen, where each name could be inscribed, the donor and the gift, to be thanked when the bride had time. One of the pantry maids dusted the offerings daily, and the butler had seen to it that the silver was polished, just as everything in the Driscoll mansion was. There was an aura of restrained opulence here, of enormous wealth that was clearly apparent but never flaunted. The heavy velvet drapes and lace curtains in the front parlor kept out curious eyes, as did the heavy gate surrounding the house, the well-tended hedge, the trees beyond. The Driscoll home was something of a fortress.<br><br>A female voice called out from the main hall just past the sweeping staircase. The voice was barely raised but one could hear it clearly, as a tall young woman with small hips, long legs, and delicately carved shoulders stepped into the front parlor. She wore a pink satin dressing gown, and she wore her reddish hair in a chignon, and she looked to be barely more than in her early twenties. There was a softness to the drape of the satin gown, yet there was nothing soft about her. She stood erect, looking directly at the table laden with gifts, her eyes moving slowly across the treasures, nodding slowly, and then stepping closer to the table to read the names she had written down ... Astor ... Tudor ... Van Camp ... Sterling ... Flood ... Watson ... Crocker ... Tobin... . They were the cream of San Francisco, of California ... of the country. Fine names, fine people, handsome gifts. Yet she did not look excited as she took a quick step to the window and stood looking out at the gardens. They were immaculately kept, just as they had been ever since her childhood. She had always loved the tulips her grandmother planted each spring, a riot of color, and so different from the flowers in Honolulu ... she had always loved this garden. She exhaled slowly, thinking of all she had to do that day, and then wheeled slowly on a pink satin heel, squinting dark blue eyes at the richly burdened table. The gifts certainly were pretty ... and the bride would be too ... if she ever went for a fitting. Audrey Driscoll glanced at her slender wrist, and the narrow diamond watch that had been her mother's. It had a small ruby clasp and she loved it.<br><br>There were two pantry maids on the main floor, a butler, an upstairs maid to tend to their bedrooms, and a cook belowstairs with a maid and an assistant of her own ... two gardeners ... a chauffeur ... in all a staff of ten that kept Audrey very busy. And yet she was used to all this. She had been running the house for fourteen years now, since she had come to the house from Hawaii. She had been eleven then, and Annabelle seven, when her parents had died in Honolulu. There had been nowhere to come but here. Her mind drifted back to the foggy morning they'd arrived, as Annabelle clutched her hand and sobbed loudly, terrified. Her grandfather had sent his housekeeper to bring them back from the Islands, and she and Annabelle had been seasick all the way home, but not Audrey, never Audrey. It was she who nursed old Mrs. Miller, the housekeeper, when she died of influenza four years later. But it was Mrs. Miller who had taught Audrey everything there was to know about running a fine old house like this one. She had also taught her exactly what her grandfather expected. And Audrey had learned her lessons well. She ran his house to perfection.<br><br>The whisper of her pink satin dressing gown was the only sound in the empty room as she hurried into the dining room, took her place at the empty table and pressed the discreet ruby and jade bell push beside her seat. She took her breakfast here every morning, unlike her sister, who ate breakfast upstairs, on a tray covered with impeccably starched linen.<br><br>A maid in a gray uniform with stiff white apron, cuffs, and cap immediately appeared, glancing nervously at the tall young woman sitting so erect in the Queen Anne chair she always occupied at the foot of the table.<br><br>"Yes, Miss Driscoll?"<br><br>"Only coffee for me this morning, thank you, Mary."<br><br>"Yes, Miss Driscoll." Her eyes like blue glass, there was no smile as Audrey watched her. They were afraid of her, most of them, except those of them who knew her well ... who remembered ... the little girl careering around the lawn ... the childhood games ... the bicycle ... the time she fell out of the Australian pine tree ... but this Mary knew none of that. She was a girl of Audrey's years, and she knew only the woman with a firm hand, and strong ideas and only secretly a splendid sense of humor. It was hidden there in the dark blue eyes ... it was there ... if one knew how to find it. But too few did ... she was only ... MissDriscoll ... the spinster... .<br><br>They called her the spinster sister. Annabelle was the beauty. It was no secret between them. And Edward Driscoll had always said it openly. Annabelle had the frail blond look of an angel, that look of total fragility that was so popular in the thirties ... and the twenties ... and decades and centuries before that... . Annabelle the little princess ... the baby ... Audrey could still remember holding her in her arms and crooning to her after their parents had died on the way home from Bora-Bora. Their father had never been able to resist an adventure, and their mother had followed him everywhere he went, for fear that he would leave her if she didn't. In the end, she had even followed him to the bottom of the ocean. The wreckage was never found. The ship went down in a storm two days out of Papeete, and the girls were left alone in the world, with only their grandfather ... poor Annabelle had been terrified when she saw him, and Audrey had held her hand so tightly their fingers were white as he watched them... . Audrey smiled to herself as she thought of it. He had terrified them even then. Or tried to ... especially poor little Annie.<br><br>Her coffee was poured from a silver pot with an ivory handle. It had come home with her from Honolulu, along with other treasures that had belonged to her parents. Her father had cared little for all of that, and most of what her mother had brought from the mainland had remained in crates. He was far more interested in jauntering around the world, far more in love with the albums he put together after his travels. Audrey had them still, on bookshelves in her room. Her grandfather hated seeing them, they only served to remind him of his loss ... his only son ... The Fool, he always called him. A wasted life ... two wasted lives ... and two little girls foisted on him. He pretended to hate the inconvenience at the time, and insisted they would have to make themselves useful. He had demanded that Annabelle learn to embroider and sew, and she had, but his demands of Audrey had been fruitless. She enjoyed neither sewing nor drawing, nor gardening, nor baking. She was hopeless at watercolors, wrote no poetry at all, hated museums, and the symphony even more ... but she liked photography, and adventure books, and tales of distant, far-off places. She went to lectures given by absurd, remote scholars, and often stood out at land's end, her eyes closed, sniffing the sea, thinking of the distant shores reached by the fingertips of the Pacific Ocean. And she ran a fine house for him, had a good hand with the servants, checked over the books for him each week, kept the house well stocked, and saw to it that no one cheated him of a penny. She would have been good at running any business, except that there was none to run. Only the home of Edward Driscoll.<br><br>"The tea is ready, Mary?" Without looking at her watch, she knew that it was eight fifteen and she knew that her grandfather would be down at any moment, dressed as he was each morning, as though he still had an office to go to. He would harrumph, look at Audrey angrily, as he always did, refuse stolidly to speak to her, glare at her once or twice, sip his tea, read the newspaper, eat two soft-boiled eggs, one slice of toast, drink one more cup of English tea, and then bid her good morning. His morning ritual did not unnerve Audrey, who barely seemed to take notice of him. She had begun reading his newspaper when she was twelve, and had discussed it with him seriously whenever she had a chance. At first, he had been amused, and then eventually he had realized how much of it she absorbed and how well formed her opinions were. They had had their first major political disagreement on her thirteenth birthday and she hadn't spoken to him for a week, much to his delight. He had been terribly proud of her then, and still was. It was a great source of pleasure when shortly afterward she found her own paper at her place in the morning. Since then she read her paper every morning, and when he finally wished to speak to her, she was more than happy to discuss with him any items that had caught his interest. They would then proceed to argue horribly about everything they read, from world politics to local news, even to stories about dinner parties given by their friends. They rarely agreed on anything, which was why Annabelle hated having breakfast with them.<br><br>"Yes, miss. The tea is ready." The maid in the gray uniform said it as though gritting her teeth, bracing herself for an enemy attack, and a moment later it came. His careful step in the hall, a...</p><h2>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Bleep: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life</h2><p><p><strong>#1 <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong></p><p><strong>Over&nbsp;5 million copies sold</strong></p><p>In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.</p><p>For decades, we&#x2019;ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life.
